question,answer
Can I have CAH if no CYP21A2 gene mutations were detected during genetic testing?,"Yes. Testing detects the most common mutations but will not detect those that are rare. If a specific mutation has been identified in your family members, then you should be tested for that mutation. Also, this test only detects CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Other, less common types of CAH will not have mutations in the CYP21A2 gene."
Should I tell all of my healthcare practitioners if I have CAH?,"Yes, this is an important thing for all of your healthcare practitioners to know. Most people with CAH will require the regular replacement of one or more hormones and will need to be monitored."
"If I have CAH, or my child does, should my family members be tested?","You should talk to your healthcare practitioner or a genetic counselor about this. Since CAH is caused by an autosomal recessive genetic mutation, both parents must have an altered gene in order for a child to have the condition. If both parents are carriers then each child has a 25% chance of having the condition."
How long will it take for 17-hydroxyprogesterone results?,This depends on the laboratory performing the test. 17-OHP testing requires specialized equipment and is not offered by every laboratory. It may be necessary to send your blood sample to a reference laboratory and it may be several days to weeks for results to be available.
How can the healthcare practitioner determine the sex of a baby with sex organs that are not clearly male or female?,Chromosome analysis (karyotyping) can be performed to identify whether the baby has XX (female) or XY (male) sex chromosomes.
Why do I have to collect my urine for 24 hours?,"The level of 5-HIAA in the urine varies throughout the day. By collecting all urine for 24 hours, the amount of 5-HIAA in the urine can be averaged over the entire day and increases of 5-HIAA will be detected more easily than in a single random urine sample."
Will my results be accurate if I must continue to take my medication?,"If the drug is one that can increase or decrease the amount of serotonin and 5-HIAA, then your results may be affected. However, it is up to your healthcare provider and you to decide whether or not your medication can be safely stopped prior to and during the test collection. If your drugs must be taken, then your healthcare practitioner will interpret the test results with this in mind."
Are some people at a higher risk for developing a carcinoid tumor?,"Anyone at any age can develop a carcinoid tumor but, according to the American Cancer Society, the average age at diagnosis is usually in the early 60s. People with a family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN1), a genetic condition that increases a person's risk of developing tumors in the endocrine system glands, may be at higher risk for developing a carcinoid tumor."
Is acetaminophen dangerous if used appropriately?,"Acetaminophen is one of the safest, most effective drugs known if used at the recommended dose and dose interval.
Children, particularly those under 6 years of age, are at risk of accidental overdose if caregivers do not follow dosing instructions carefully. However, the reported incidence for children are not as common as in adults. Deaths are typically only seen in cases involving multi-drug combinations."
"In addition to acetaminophen levels, what other lab tests might be done?","Since high levels of acetaminophen can be toxic to the liver, healthcare practitioners may also order tests such as AST and ALT to detect liver damage. A PT may be used to detect impaired liver function. A healthcare practitioner might also order serum salicylate levels or a urine drug screen for unconscious patients or those for whom there is a suspicion of ingestion of other substances. Other possible tests include blood gases, lactate level, and metabolic panel with creatinine. These are used to monitor severity of liver failure and, in cases of severe overdose, determine whether an overdose patient would benefit from liver transplantation.
Women of childbearing age who have suspected acetaminophen overdose may get human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) tests to determine if they are pregnant because the drug crosses the placenta and can harm the fetus."
Can this test be performed in my healthcare provider's office?,"No, it is specialized testing that is not offered by every laboratory. Your blood sample will likely need to be sent to a reference laboratory for testing."
How serious is myasthenia gravis (MG)?,"Most people who have it can live a normal or near normal life with treatment and monitoring. One of the most serious complications is a respiratory myasthenic crisis that can occur when muscles that control breathing are weakened. This can be a medical emergency and often requires hospitalization. For additional details, see the article on Myasthenia Gravis."
Can myasthenia gravis affect my heart?,"No, the receptors for heart and smooth (digestive) muscles are different from skeletal muscles, so they are not affected by the formation of AChR antibodies."
Can MG be passed from one person to another?,"MG is not contagious, but a pregnant woman with MG can pass some of her AChR antibodies to her fetus. This can cause a newborn to have MG symptoms for several weeks after birth."
Can MG be inherited?,"As an autoimmune process, no. Some people may inherit a genetic defect that causes congenital myasthenic syndrome, a condition with similar symptoms."
Can I have a tuberculosis (TB) infection and not be sick?,"Yes. There are many people in the United States and worldwide who have a latent form of TB infection. They have been exposed to the bacteria, but their body's immune system has confined it to a localized area in their lungs, in an inactive form. People with latent TB infections are not sick and they are not infectious, but the bacteria are still there and still alive. If those with latent infections are tested, most would have a positive TB skin test or IGRA test. The majority of people with latent TB infection, about 90%, will never progress to active tuberculosis disease.
Those who do have active TB may not feel ill at first. Early symptoms may be subtle and, if the TB is extrapulmonary (outside of the lungs in organs such as the kidney and bone), the tuberculosis may be fairly advanced by the time it causes noticeable symptoms."
What is the difference between multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively-resistant TB (XDR-TB)?,"Both indicate strains of Mycobacteria tuberculosis that can be difficult to treat, but XDR-TB is resistant to more drug therapies. MDR-TB is resistant to the two most powerful drugs, isoniazid and rifampin. XDR-TB is currently defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization as M. tuberculosis that is resistant to isoniazid and rifampin plus resistant to any fluoroquinolone and to at least one of three injectable ""second-line"" drugs (amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin). The emergence of XDR-TB represents a public health risk and is being closely watched by the world medical community and measures are being taken in hopes of limiting its spread."
Why is my healthcare provider asking me to take my TB medication in the presence of a nurse?,"The practice of taking TB medications in the presence of a healthcare practitioner is known as direct observed therapy (DOT). DOT ensures that people are taking their medications and continuing their therapy for the required length of time. Unlike other bacterial infections that can be cured in 7-10 days, TB must be treated with two or more drugs for several months. People tend to forget to take their medication when they are feeling better. Since TB medications must be taken for many months, the risk of non-compliance is high. Having a healthcare practitioner administer the medications weekly increases the likelihood that the entire regimen will be completed and decreases the likelihood that someone will relapse with a more resistant strain of TB."
"Besides TB, what other types of mycobacteria can be identified with AFB testing?","Examples of other mycobacteria that can cause infections and are detected using AFB tests include:

Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC)—can cause a lung infection in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with AIDS; this infection is not contagious but it can be difficult to treat as it tends to be highly resistant to antibiotics.
Mycobacterial species, such as Mycobacterium marinum, grow in water, such as fish tanks, and can cause skin infections.
Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium abscessus and Mycobacterium chelonae, and other rapidly growing mycobacteria, cause skin and wound infections following cosmetic surgery, prosthetic device implantation, and visits to nail salons.
A few mycobacteria, such as Mycobacterium bovis, can sometimes be transferred from animals to humans.

See the article on Nontuberculous Mycobacteria for more examples and details.
Nocardia species are not a type of mycobacteria but can be detected using some AFB laboratory tests. Nocardia can cause infections of the lungs, brain, or skin."
I have been taking prednisone (glucocorticoid medication) for some time. Why would suddenly stopping it cause signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency?,"Glucocorticoids such as prednisone, hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, etc. are prescribed for a variety of conditions. These medications can suppress cortisol production by the adrenal glands. If you need to stop taking them, your healthcare practitioner will usually taper off your dose so that your adrenal gland cortisol production has time to restart and you avoid ""withdrawal"" adrenal insufficiency symptoms. In some people who have taken glucocorticoids chronically (especially at high dose) for various medical conditions (other than Addison disease), it may take up to one year for the body to resume normal cortisol production after the glucocorticoids are stopped."
What are the causes of primary adrenal insufficiency?,"The most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency in adults in the U.S. is an autoimmune disorder where the body's immune system attacks the adrenal glands. The most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency in children in the U.S. is a congenital disease called congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Other causes in any age group include damage from bleeding into the adrenal glands and infections such as tuberculosis or HIV infection. (For more, see Adrenal Insufficiency and Addison Disease)."
Why is my healthcare provider testing me for 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies and/or adrenal cytoplasmic autoantibodies?,Tests for these autoantibodies can help determine the cause of primary adrenal insufficiency. The most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency in adults (about 75%) is an autoimmune process in which an inappropriate immune response destroys tissues within the adrenal glands. 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies and/or adrenal cytoplasmic autoantibodies are markers of this autoimmune process.
Is ACT ever done in the central laboratory?,"The ACT test is rarely performed in the central laboratory. It is a point-of-care test that must be performed immediately after the blood is collected, close to the patient, usually at the bedside, in the operating room, or in a satellite laboratory close to these locations. The ACT result is needed quickly to guide treatment."
Can lupus anticoagulant interfere with the ACT test?,"In some patients, the presence of a lupus anticoagulant (LAC) has been shown to prolong the ACT, but in other cases the ACT may be relatively unaffected. Nevertheless, the presence of LAC has been shown to interfere with certain ACT testing. Therefore, it is important for the laboratory to follow the manufacturer's instructions and determine if the test is suitable to monitor heparin therapy in a person with documented history of LAC or antiphospholipid syndrome."
Are these tests always run as a panel?,"No. Sometimes, if the particular hepatitis virus a person was exposed to is known, tests specific for that virus may be performed. Also, some of these tests are used for other purposes, such as monitoring the progression of disease or determining if treatment is working, and they may be run singly or in different combinations in those cases. For more about other tests used in viral hepatitis infections, see the individual articles on Hepatitis A Testing, Hepatitis B Testing, and Hepatitis C Testing."
What other laboratory tests might my healthcare practitioner perform?,"In addition to tests for hepatitis viruses, your healthcare practitioner may choose to run tests to see how your liver has been affected. These may include a liver panel or individual liver enzyme tests such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Your healthcare practitioner may also run a test for bilirubin and a prothrombin time (PT), which can help determine if there is liver damage."
"If I have viral hepatitis, am I contagious?","You may be contagious; it depends on which hepatitis virus you were infected with and the stage of your infection. Often, people with viral hepatitis can spread the infection even though they don't have symptoms. With hepatitis A, you may be contagious from the time you are infected and continue to be contagious, but less so, for several weeks after symptoms, such as jaundice, develop. A person with hepatitis B is contagious as long as the virus is present in their blood. Anyone who tests positive for the presence of hepatitis C virus (HCV RNA test) should be considered contagious. The HCV RNA test may be performed as follow up to a positive result for anti-HCV."
The results of my hepatitis panel came back negative.  What other conditions can cause similar symptoms?,"Hepatitis can be caused by several different factors and conditions such as alcohol, drugs like acetaminophen, or inherited disorders. (For more on these, see the article on Hepatitis.) There are a few other viral infections that may cause similar symptoms, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). An autoimmune disease is another possibility your healthcare provider may need to consider if your hepatitis panel is negative. Typically, additional tests will be performed to help determine the cause of your condition."
Can my doctor diagnose tuberculosis without testing my pleural fluid?,"A healthcare practitioner cannot diagnose tuberculosis in the pleural space without testing the pleural fluid. If the infection is present in your lungs, then sputum may be collected or, if meningitis is suspected, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) would be tested."
Should everyone with suspected tuberculosis have an ADA test performed?,"The ADA test is primarily performed when tuberculosis is suspected in the pleurae, and it is not routinely available in all laboratories. It will be performed when a healthcare practitioner determines that it will be useful and timely in helping to diagnose or rule out tuberculosis."
Can my blood be tested for ADA?,"Yes, and it sometimes is, but it is done for another purpose and not to detect tuberculosis. The blood may be tested to help identify ADA deficiency."
What is the difference between Cushing disease and Cushing syndrome?,"Cushing disease is caused by a pituitary gland tumor (usually benign) that over-secretes the hormone ACTH, thus overstimulating the adrenal glands' cortisol production. Cushing syndrome refers to the signs and symptoms associated with excess cortisol in the body, regardless of the cause. In addition to a pituitary tumor, taking steroid hormones (often used to treat cancer or autoimmune diseases), adrenal gland tumors, and ACTH-producing tumors outside the pituitary gland can cause Cushing syndrome."
What conditions other than liver problems can cause increased ALT?,"ALT is more specific for the liver than AST and so is much less affected by conditions affecting other parts of the body. Nevertheless, injury to organs other than the liver, such as the heart and skeletal muscle, can cause elevations of ALT. For example, small increases may be seen with skeletal muscle damage or heart attacks."
What other tests may be performed to help determine the cause of liver damage?,"After a thorough physical exam and evaluation of a person's medical history, there are several other tests that may be performed as follow up depending on what is suspected to be the cause of liver damage. Some of these include:

Tests for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C
Testing for exposure to drugs and other substances toxic to the liver (see Drug Abuse Testing and Emergency and Overdose Drug Testing)
Ethanol level
Serum copper level and ceruloplasmin for Wilson disease
Iron tests and genetic tests for hereditary hemochromatosis

A liver biopsy may be performed to help determine the cause of liver injury and to evaluate the extent of liver damage.
For more information, see the article on Liver Disease."
Is anyone at high risk for abnormal albumin levels?,"Individuals who have chronic liver disease and kidney disorders are at highest risk for developing abnormal albumin levels. In addition, individuals whose gastrointestinal tract doesn't absorb nutrients properly and individuals who have prolonged diarrhea can develop abnormal albumin levels."
Is there a home test for albumin levels?,Not for blood albumin; you can test for high albumin levels in urine with a dipstick purchased in a drug store.
"What is the difference between serum/plasma albumin, prealbumin, and urine albumin tests?","Although the names are similar, albumin and prealbumin are completely different molecules. They are both proteins made by the liver, however, and both have been used historically to evaluate nutritional status. Serum/plasma (or blood) albumin is now more often used to screen for and help diagnose liver or kidney disease and is tested on a blood sample. The urine albumin test (in the past, called a microalbumin test) detects and measures albumin in the urine as an early indicator of kidney damage."
"If my posture is important in the outcome of the results, how can I control it?",You may be asked to arrive well before your testing time so you can remain in a lying or upright position long enough to establish that as your baseline testing position.
What are aldosterone stimulation and suppression tests?,"Aldosterone suppression tests are used to confirm a diagnosis of primary aldosteronism. There are a few different types of suppression tests:

You may be instructed to follow a high-salt diet for three days, then have your aldosterone and sodium in your urine measured.
You may have a saline (salt) solution administered through a vein (intravenous, IV) and then have your aldosterone level measured.
You may follow a high-salt diet and be administered a synthetic corticosteroid called fludrocortisone, then have your aldosterone level measured.

In healthy people who are on a high-salt diet or who are administered saline or fludrocortisone, their aldosterone level will be suppressed.
The aldosterone stimulation test, also called ACTH stimulation, tests aldosterone and cortisol to determine if someone has adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease), low pituitary function, or a pituitary tumor. This test involves measuring aldosterone and cortisol before and after an injection of synthetic ACTH. A normal result is an increase in aldosterone and cortisol after stimulation by ACTH."
Should everyone with lung cancer have ALK mutation testing?,Testing is not generally indicated unless a person has non-small cell lung cancer.
Is it necessary to repeat an ALK mutation test?,"This is not usually necessary but might occur if the healthcare practitioner thought that the first sample tested might have been insufficient. In the rare instances where the original biopsy tissue is not sufficient, a new biopsy will be collected from the patient following the biopsy procedure."
Can I receive ALK kinase inhibitor drug therapy and still not benefit from it?,"Yes, most people whose lung cancer has the ALK gene rearrangement will respond, but a percentage will not. Each person and each cancer is different. Also, a person may respond initially and then become resistant to the treatment."
Can I take an ALK kinase inhibitor drug therapy without being tested?,"In most cases, this is not recommended. The drugs have been developed with specific associations and your lung cancer is not likely to respond if you do not meet the identified criteria."
Can this test be performed by my local laboratory?,"It may be available in some larger laboratories and hospitals designated as Comprehensive Cancer Centers by the National Cancer Institute, but most often it will be sent to a reference laboratory."
Can this test be performed on my blood instead?,"Yes, ALK rearrangements could be detected in the DNA of tumor cells that is shed in the blood; however, it is not as reliable as the tissue-based test. Blood testing could be useful when no tissue is available for testing, but the procedure is still investigational."
What other tests are used to evaluate liver disorders?,"There are other commonly used liver tests that measure other enzymes found in liver cells, such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). A test for bilirubin, a substance produced by the breakdown of red blood cells and removed from the body by the liver, may also be performed. Sometimes these tests (along with albumin and total protein testing) are run together as a liver panel. Other tests that may be performed individually or as part of a liver panel to detect or monitor liver disease include gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and prothrombin time (PT)."
Who is at risk for liver disease and/or damage?,"Some of those who are at risk of liver disease include the following:

People who have been exposed to hepatitis viruses
Heavy drinkers
People who take medication that can be toxic to the liver or who are exposed to other liver toxins
Those who are obese, have metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance
Those who suffer from congestive heart failure
People with an inherited disorder affecting the liver such as Wilson disease or hemochromatosis

See the article on Liver Disease for more on these."
What other laboratory tests may be done if I have a bone disorder?,"Depending on the cause, your condition may be diagnosed and/or monitored using other tests such as calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, or bone markers (a group of tests used to measure bone formation and bone resorption)."
What other tests are available for allergy testing?,"Skin prick or scratch tests, intradermal tests, patch tests, and oral food challenges are usually performed by an allergist or dermatologist. These tests can be subjective and depend on factors such as dose of allergens, administration of the tests, and interpretation of results.
Your healthcare provider may also try eliminating foods from your diet and then reintroducing them to find out what you are allergic to. It is important that these tests be done under close medical supervision, as a life-threatening anaphylactic reaction is possible."
"My allergy test was negative, but I continue to have symptoms. What else could it be?","You could have an allergy-like condition that is not mediated by IgE for which there are no specific laboratory tests. You might have a genetic hypersensitivity problem, such as sensitivity to gluten with celiac disease or have an enzyme deficiency, such as a lactase deficiency causing lactose intolerance. It could also be another disease that is causing allergy-like symptoms. It is important to investigate your individual situation with your healthcare provider's assistance. Test results alone cannot diagnose allergies, but rather confirm a diagnosis when circumstances suggest an allergy is likely. Results from any type of allergy test have to be interpreted along with your medical history by a healthcare practitioner who is trained to diagnose allergies specifically."
My allergy symptoms are generally mild. How serious is this really?,"Allergic reactions are very individual. They can be mild or severe, vary from exposure to exposure, get worse over time (or may not), involve the whole body, and can sometimes be fatal."
Will my allergies ever go away?,"Although children do outgrow some allergies, adults usually do not. Allergies that cause the worst reactions, such as anaphylaxis caused by peanuts, do not usually go away. Avoidance of the allergen and advance preparation for accidental exposure, in the form of medications such as antihistamines and portable epinephrine injections, is the safest course. Immunotherapy can help decrease symptoms for some unavoidable allergies but won't work for food and the treatment, which usually consists of years of regular injections, may need to be continued indefinitely."
What can I do to take care of myself if I have alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency?,"Don’t smoke. Taking care of your lungs can increase your lifespan and delay the onset of emphysema. Avoid lung irritants such as dust and fumes, get regular vaccinations to protect against pneumococcal pneumonia and Haemophilus influenzae type b infections, for example, and an annual influenza shot, get prompt medical attention for lung infections, and get regular exercise to help maintain lung function. Work with your healthcare practitioner to determine what steps will help you take care of yourself."
How common is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency?,"It is thought to be one of the most frequent genetic deficiencies in Caucasians. The American Lung Association estimates that as many as 100,000 people in the U.S. are born with AAT deficiency each year and that as many as 25 million Americans are carriers of at least one deficient gene. AAT is an under diagnosed condition. About only 10% of severely deficient individuals have been identified."
Do I need to have all three types of AAT testing?,"Usually, no. The number of tests and the order in which they are done depend upon the laboratory or medical facility performing the testing. In most cases, the AAT blood test and either the phenotype or genotype test are sufficient. In difficult or unusual cases, all three tests may be ordered."
What are the risk factors for liver cancer?,"This cancer usually occurs when you have chronic scarring of the liver, called cirrhosis. Most commonly, this is caused by chronic infection from one of two viruses: hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Alcohol abuse also increases the risk of developing cirrhosis. Some inherited diseases, especially a disorder called hemochromatosis (in which the body absorbs too much iron, which gets deposited in liver among other organs), can cause cirrhosis and, in time, hepatocellular carcinoma, as can non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is fat deposition in the liver, along with inflammation and damage."
"If my AFP is abnormal, do I need other tests?","If you have chronic liver infection or damage and your AFP suddenly rises, or if it is very elevated, your healthcare practitioner will usually ask for a study to look at your liver, such as an ultrasound exam, a CT scan, an MRI scan, or a biopsy for histopathological evaluation of tumor tissues. The scans can usually spot liver cancers if they are present. Your healthcare practitioner may also order a blood test for des-gamma carboxy prothrombin (DCP), which is also known as prothrombin induced by vitamin K absence-II (PIVKA-II), to help detect and monitor liver cancer."
Can an AFP test be performed at home or in my healthcare practitioner's office?,AFP is not available as a home test and it is not typically performed in a healthcare practitioner's office. Testing is done by either a hospital laboratory or a reference laboratory.
Can I have my level tested at home?,"Although you may receive intravenous aminoglycoside therapy at home, usually administered by a home health professional, blood levels cannot be monitored at home. The test requires specialized equipment and must be performed in a laboratory. The home health professional may draw a blood sample prior to administering the next dose of drug. This sample will be sent to a laboratory for analysis."
Why are aminoglycosides used at all if they can cause permanent hearing loss?,There are risks and benefits associated with almost all drug therapies. Aminoglycosides continue to be very effective at killing Gram-negative bacteria and sometimes these drugs are the best alternative for successfully treating serious infections.
Should all antibiotic therapy be monitored like aminoglycosides?,"No, not all antibiotics require monitoring. Unlike aminoglycosides, most antibiotics are not associated with significant side effects that are predictable with drug levels. They have a larger therapeutic range in which they are effective. Because of this, they can be prescribed based upon pre-established dosing schedules."
Is ammonia testing used to detect or monitor ammonia poisoning?,"Not generally. In most cases, ammonia acts locally, burning or irritating whatever it comes in contact with, but according to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), it does not usually act as a systemic poison. Concentrated commercial ammonia, in a liquid or vapor form, can cause more severe burns than the more dilute liquid household ammonia, but both can damage the eyes, skin, respiratory tract, and, if swallowed, the mouth, throat, and stomach."
"When my increased ammonia level has returned to normal, can it rise again?","It depends on why it was increased in the first place. If you had a temporary condition, then it is likely that the ammonia level will continue to be normal. If you have a chronic condition, then it is possible that it will increase again and your health status will likely need to be monitored. Talk to your healthcare provider about what is best for you."
Should every pregnant woman have amniotic fluid analysis?,"This is a highly personal decision, and one best made by a woman and her healthcare provider working together. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that all pregnant women be given the option of having amniocentesis performed. Although the associated risk is low, it must be weighed against the desire for information that would be gained by testing. Speaking with a genetic counselor may also be helpful in learning more about the various types of testing available and what to expect from the information that can be learned through them."
Can amniotic fluid analysis be performed in my healthcare practitioner's office?,"No, the testing requires specialized equipment and training to interpret. It needs to be performed in a laboratory and may need to be sent to a reference laboratory. However, the procedure for collecting the amniotic fluid can be done in an outpatient setting, such as a healthcare practitioner's office."
Is the amount of amniotic fluid present important?,"It is in the sense that if there is too much or too little fluid present, it may indicate a problem with the fetus, the placenta, or both. Ultrasound is typically used to estimate the amount of amniotic fluid that is present.

Too little amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios) occurs in approximately 11% of all pregnancies. It is most commonly caused by leaking of amniotic fluid due to a tear in the amniotic sac (premature rupture of the membranes), but it can also be caused by an abnormality of the fetal kidneys and/or urinary tract. If the fetal kidneys are not functioning normally, they will not produce enough urine to replace what the fetus swallows, and if there is a blockage of the urinary tract, it can prevent the urine from cycling back out to the amniotic fluid sac. Pregnancies affected by oligohydramnios are at higher risk for adverse fetal outcomes and should be monitored with care.
Too much amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios) occurs in approximately 1% of all pregnancies and while it typically is not associated with significant issues, it if is severe, it can affect the mother by causing shortness of breath, preterm labor, or severe post-delivery bleeding. In some cases, draining of excess fluid by amniocentesis may be required. In approximately 20% of pregnancies with polyhydramnios, a fetal abnormality is identified, such as an incompletely formed esophagus that prevents the fetus from swallowing the amniotic fluid. However, a majority of the time, the cause is not clear."
Do elevated amylase levels always mean that I have a pancreatic condition?,"No. Amylase levels may also be significantly increased in people with gallbladder attacks. Urine and blood amylase levels may be moderately elevated with a variety of other conditions, such as ovarian cancer, lung cancer, tubal pregnancy, acute appendicitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, mumps, intestinal obstruction, or perforated ulcer, but amylase tests are not generally used to diagnose or monitor these disorders."
Can medications that I am taking affect the amylase level?,"Yes. Some drugs that may cause amylase to rise include aspirin, diuretics, oral contraceptives, corticosteroids, indomethacin, ethyl alcohol, and opiates (such as codeine and morphine)."
What is the difference between P-amylase and S-amylase?,"Amylase is an enzyme that has several different forms called isoenzymes. Different tissues make different forms. P-amylase refers to the type of amylase made mainly in the pancreas. S-amylase refers to the type of amylase made mainly by the salivary glands. P-amylase in the blood increases when the pancreas is inflamed or damaged. S-amylase in the blood increases when the salivary gland is inflamed or damaged. Measuring pancreatic amylase, or P-amylase, may be useful in determining if an increase in a total amylase level is due to acute pancreatitis."
Does everyone with elevated androstenedione have symptoms?,"Not necessarily. The type and severity of symptoms will vary from person to person and will vary with age. Adult men have already developed masculine secondary sexual characteristics, so they will not typically experience symptoms with increased androstenedione."
How long will it take for androstenedione test results?,This depends on the laboratory performing the test. It is not a routine test and not all laboratories offer it. Your sample may need to be sent to a reference laboratory for testing. It may take several days for results to be available.
"Is this test used for purposes other than detecting problems with the adrenal gland, ovaries or testicles?  ","Yes, the level of androstenedione (or ""andro"") can be done as part of testing for sports doping. Androstenedione is sometimes taken illegally by athletes as a performance-enhancing drug. The body converts it to an anabolic steroid (a synthetic version of testosterone). It is intended to help build muscle, but like other anabolic steroids, it can interfere with bone growth, affect the heart, and in some cases cause liver damage."
What other tests are used to diagnose sarcoidosis?,"A variety of tests may be ordered, both to help diagnose sarcoidosis and to determine the degree of organ involvement. Laboratory tests may include a liver panel, complete blood count (CBC), and calcium (both blood and urine levels may be elevated). Other tests may include a physical exam for skin lesions, pulmonary function tests as about 90% of the time there will be some degree of lung involvement, bronchoscopy (a procedure that uses a flexible tube to look at the lining of the airway and to biopsy the lung), chest x-ray, and gallium screening (radioactive gallium is used to evaluate inflammation). Biopsies of the skin, lungs, lymph nodes, and sometimes liver may also be needed, as may a thorough eye exam. A test called a slit-lamp examination may be used."
What causes sarcoidosis?,"The cause is not well understood. It is not contagious. It is inflammatory and involves the immune system. It appears to have a genetic component as well as an environmental one. It has been reported both in related and unrelated individuals living in the same area. Up to 40 people per 100,000 are affected in the U.S., the majority of them between 20 and 40 years old. In the U.S. and in the Caribbean, sarcoidosis is more common in those of African descent, but worldwide about 80% of those with sarcoidosis are white. It is relatively common in Scandinavia and Northern Ireland, but rare in China, Japan, and Africa. For some reason, those who have moved from a part of the world where the prevalence is low to a part of the world where it is high tend to take on the risk of the higher prevalence area."
Can an anti-DNase B or an ASO be used to diagnose strep throat?,No. A rapid strep test and/or throat culture are the best methods to diagnose strep throat. It is important that strep throat be promptly identified and treated to avoid complications and to avoid passing the infection on to others.
Can I develop rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis at the same time as my strep throat?,"These complications typically develop after the initial strep infection resolves. There is a delay when signs and symptoms appear after the streptococcal infection, about 1-2 weeks for glomerulonephritis and about 2-3 weeks for rheumatic fever."
"If I am diagnosed with strep, will an anti-DNase B or ASO always be performed?","No. In general, these tests are only performed when you have symptoms suggesting that a complication may have developed after a group A strep infection that was not diagnosed and treated appropriately. Most people do not experience these complications, so these tests are not routinely done."
"Like the rapid strep test, can the anti-DNase B test be performed in my doctor's office?","Most doctors' offices will not perform this test, and some laboratories may not offer it. Your blood will typically be sent to a reference laboratory for testing."
Why might it take a long time to be diagnosed with lupus?,"A healthcare practitioner must rely not only test results, but on clinical symptoms and the person's history for a diagnosis. Symptoms may be nonspecific and often come and go. Test results may not initially be positive for some of these autoantibodies due to the cyclic nature of autoimmune disorders. In some cases, it may take months or years to show a pattern that might suggest lupus or any of the other autoimmune diseases."
"If I have been diagnosed with lupus, will it ever go away?  ","There is no cure for lupus, but the symptoms and complications can be managed. Most people with the condition will experience flare-ups, but most will also have periods of few or mild symptoms."
Will my anti-dsDNA ever go away?,"No, once the autoantibody has been produced by the body, it will continue to be present. However, the concentration in the blood will vary over time and can be present at very low levels."
Is there anything I can do to affect my anti-dsDNA level?,Autoantibodies do not respond to lifestyle changes because they reflect the presence and severity of an autoimmune process.
Can the anti-dsDNA test be performed at my healthcare practitioner's office?,The test requires specialized equipment. Your sample will need to be sent to a laboratory that performs these tests.
Should everyone with liver damage be tested for liver kidney microsome type 1 antibodies (anti-LKM-1)?,"This is not usually necessary. Most cases of hepatitis will be due to another identifiable cause. However, if the person with symptoms is a young girl without other risk factors and/or the healthcare practitioner suspects an autoimmune process, then anti-LKM-1, ANA, and SMA testing may be performed."
Will anti-LKM-1 ever go away?,"No. Levels may vary over time, but once the autoantibodies have developed, they will be present throughout a person's life."
Can I have more than one cause of hepatitis?,"Yes. For instance, autoimmune hepatitis can co-exist with a viral hepatitis, such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C, and can become worse with liver damage caused by alcohol abuse. Since the treatment of hepatitis depends on the cause, it is very important that your healthcare practitioner understand the underlying cause(s) of your condition."
How fast does autoimmune hepatitis progress?,"The course and severity of autoimmune hepatitis is hard to predict. It may be acute or chronic. Some people will have no or few symptoms for many years and are diagnosed when routine liver tests are abnormal. Those with type 2 autoimmune hepatitis often have a more severe case, but it is usually manageable with proper treatment. Appropriate treatment is important to limit liver damage. For more information, consult with your healthcare provider and see the related links."
"If this antibody targets CYP450 2D6, why is it called anti-liver kidney microsome-1 (anti-LKM-1)?  ","This antibody was originally detected using tissue from the liver and kidney, hence the name anti-LKM-1. However, the specific protein in those tissues that the antibody targets (the major antigen) has since been identified as cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). This protein is a major enzyme that metabolizes about 25% of drugs as well as toxic substances. It is primarily found in cells of the liver and kidney, mainly within structures called microsomes."
How long does it take for AMH results?,This test requires specialized equipment and must be performed in a laboratory. Your blood may need to be sent to a reference laboratory and it may take one to several days for results to be available.
How serious is myasthenia gravis (MG)?,"Most people who have MG can live a normal or near normal life with treatment and monitoring. One of the most serious complications is a respiratory myasthenic crisis that can occur when muscles that control breathing are weakened. This can be a medical emergency and often requires hospitalization. For additional details, see the article on Myasthenia Gravis."
Does it matter which antibodies I have?,"Yes, the type of autoantibody may guide the treatment for MG. People with anti-MuSK antibodies may respond differently to medications than people with AChR antibodies."
Can MG be inherited?,"Autoimmune disorders are not caused by changes or variants in a specific gene, so they are not considered inherited conditions. They can run in families, however. Some people may inherit a genetic change that causes congenital myasthenic syndrome, which is an inherited condition with similar symptoms as MG but a different cause. For additional details, see the links in Related Content."
"Besides ASCA, what other testing may be done?","In some cases, several antibody tests, including ASCA, perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA), anti-CBir1 (anti-flagellin antibody), and anti-Omp C (anti-outer membrane protein antibody), may be ordered together as a panel and the overall findings evaluated to either help distinguish between CD and UC or to try to help determine a prognosis for a person's CD. The presence of Anti-CBir1 and anti-Omp C are indicative of CD. The presence of multiple antibodies may indicate the likelihood of a more aggressive disease, but negative results do not rule out aggressive disease.
Since the symptoms associated with IBD may be seen with a number of conditions, other tests are frequently performed prior to or along with ASCA testing to rule out other causes for the symptoms. For more on this, see the article on Inflammatory Bowel Disease."
Is it necessary to perform ASCA testing more than once?,"Testing is usually only performed once, to help distinguish between CD and UC. Once a decision has been made, there is generally no need for repeat testing. It is typical to order tests for the two classes of antibody, ASCA IgG and ASCA IgA, at the same time. However, if only one of the types was initially ordered, then the other type (or more likely both) may be ordered at a later date."
Will ASCA go away once they have developed?,"The level of antibody may vary over time, but once a person's body has produced ASCA, it will continue to be present."
Would a doctor ever prescribe an antibiotic without or before performing a culture?,"Yes. In certain situations, a healthcare practitioner may choose a therapy while a culture is incubating; and in other cases, the practitioner may prescribe therapy without ever ordering a culture based on knowledge and experience. While it is impossible to predict which microbe is causing an infection unless a culture is performed, some organisms are seen more frequently than others. For instance, most urinary tract infections (UTIs) are caused by the bacterium Escherichia coli. Knowing this, a practitioner may rely on current susceptibility patterns for E. coli to choose an antibiotic that is likely to be effective in most cases.
In addition, there are certain life-threatening infections, such as meningitis, that must be treated immediately, with no time to wait for the results of a culture. In other instances, a culture would not be attempted because a specimen may not be obtainable, such as with otitis media – inner ear infections. In these cases, the practitioner chooses therapy to cover the most common pathogens that cause these infections."
How do microbes become resistant to antimicrobial drugs?,"Resistance may be innate (natural) or acquired. Natural resistance is part of the microbe's normal physical and genetic characteristics. Since microbes multiply very rapidly; they go through many generations in a short period of time. There is always the potential for antimicrobial resistance to arise through a genetic change (mutation). If this change gives the microbe a survival advantage, it may be passed on to subsequent generations.
An acquired resistance may develop through a selection process. When someone is treated with an antimicrobial drug, the most susceptible microbes are the ones that are killed first. If treatment is stopped before all of the pathogens are killed, the survivors may develop a resistance to that particular antimicrobial drug. The next time they are exposed to the same drug, it may be ineffective as the bacteria and their progeny are likely to retain resistance to that antimicrobial drug.
Resistance can spread when resistant microbes share their genetic material with susceptible ones. This may occur more frequently in a healthcare setting, where many patients are treated with antimicrobial drugs. For instance, resistant strains of bacteria, such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), have been a problem in hospitals for decades and are increasingly common in the community.
A resistant microbe may spread to other people throughout a community. Once a strain of bacteria has become resistant to one or more antimicrobial drug, the only recourse is to try to inhibit its spread and to try to find another one that will kill it. The second or third choice antimicrobial drugs that are available are often more expensive and associated with more side effects. This presents a challenge that is compounded by the fact that microbes are becoming resistant faster than new antimicrobial drugs are being developed."
Are there other ways of testing for resistance?,"Sometimes molecular methods are used to look for changes (mutations) in a microbe's genetic material that enables it to grow in the presence of certain antimicrobial drugs. For instance, methicillin-resistant Staphylcoccus aureus (MRSA) contain the mecA gene that confers resistance to the antibiotics methicillin, oxacillin, nafcillin, and dicloxacillin. Detection of the mecA gene using a molecular based test allows the rapid detection of MRSA prior to culturing the bacteria. Someone carrying this microbe in their nasal passages can be isolated from other patients in the hospital so that the resistant staph are not transmitted to others."
Is there anything I can do to decrease my anticentromere antibody level?,"No, it does not respond to lifestyle changes."
Will my anticentromere antibody ever go away?,"Concentrations of ACA in the blood may vary over time, but once you have developed ACA, you will continue to produce them for life."
Can anticentromere testing be done at my healthcare practitioner's office?,No. ACA testing requires collection of a blood sample by a trained medical professional. The testing itself requires specialized equipment and trained medical laboratory personnel. It is not offered by every laboratory and usually is performed by a reference laboratory.
Are there medications that can affect ADH levels?,"Many medications can affect ADH levels. They include:

Drugs that stimulate ADH release, such as: barbiturates, desipramine, morphine, nicotine, amitriptyline and carbamazepine.
Drugs that promote ADH action, such as: acetaminophen, metformin, tolbutamide, aspirin, theophylline, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
Drugs that decrease ADH or its effects, such as: ethanol, lithium, and phenytoin."
How is diabetes insipidus different than diabetes mellitus?,"Diabetes mellitus, usually referred to as diabetes, is related to either decreased insulin production or insulin resistance and causes an increase in blood glucose. Diabetes insipidus is not related to insulin or glucose. The ancient Greeks, in naming the diseases, thought that both conditions were similar because persons with them had increased thirst and frequent urination. They were different in that, in one, the urine was sweet (diabetes mellitus) while in the other, it was tasteless (diabetes insipidus)."
What causes primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)?,"The cause is currently not known. It is not infectious and not inherited, although an increased susceptibility to develop autoimmune disorders may occur in some families. It can occur in anyone at any age, but it is primarily seen in middle-aged women."
How fast does PBC progress?,"The course and severity of PBC is difficult to predict. Many people will have no or few symptoms for many years. For more information, consult with your healthcare practitioner and see the links in the Related Pages section."
Can I have an AMA or AMA-M2 test done in my healthcare practitioner's office?,"No, the test requires specialized equipment and will not be offered by all laboratories. Your blood will likely be sent to a reference laboratory."
"If I have AMA, will the antibodies ever go away?","The level of antibody (titer) may vary over time but, in most cases, once a person has detectable AMA, that person will continue to do so."
"Besides ANCA, what other lab tests may be done?","Additional tests that may be performed to aid in diagnosis include erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and/or C-reactive protein (CRP) to check for inflammation, complete blood count (CBC) to measure and evaluate white and red blood cells, and urinalysis, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine to evaluate kidney function. For some patients, tests for viruses such as hepatitis or cytomegalovirus may be ordered.
Since the symptoms associated with vasculitis and inflammatory bowel disease may be seen with a number of conditions, other tests are frequently performed prior to or along with ANCA testing to rule out other causes for the symptoms."
Will my antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) ever go away?,"Levels may fluctuate, but once you develop an autoantibody, you will continue to have it."
Can the ANCA test be performed at my local lab?,"ANCA testing requires specialized equipment and careful interpretation by trained professionals. Your sample will need to be sent to a clinical laboratory that performs these tests and may be sent to a reference laboratory. Depending on the lab, it may take a few days to a week for results to be available."
Are there conditions other than vasculitis and inflammatory bowel disease that can cause a positive ANCA?,"Yes. These conditions include rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), lung conditions, autoimmune hepatitis, use of certain drugs, and infections involving the heart (endocarditis) or the respiratory system."
Can I have a positive ANA and not have an autoimmune disease?,"Yes. About 3-5% of healthy individuals may be positive for ANA, and it may reach as high as 10-37% in healthy individuals over the age of 65 because ANA frequency increases with age. These would be considered false-positive results because they are not associated with an autoimmune disease. Such instances are more common in women than men."
"Why is it called ""antinuclear"" antibody?","ANA are autoantibodies that are directed against certain components found in the nucleus of a cell, hence the name ""antinuclear."" Some of the antibodies associated with autoimmune disorders may also be directed against substances in the cytoplasm and may be detected by the ANA test as well."
My healthcare practitioner told me my ANA test is positive but isn't sure if I have lupus. How can this be?,Autoimmune diseases often have a systemic effect on the body and are very complex by nature. Your healthcare provider will interpret what the test results mean for you and may need to compare your test results as well as the severity of your symptoms over a period of time in order to make a definitive diagnosis. This additional time may also allow your healthcare provider to eliminate other possible causes of your symptoms.
"In addition to autoantibody tests, what other tests might my healthcare practitioner order?","Your healthcare practitioner may also order laboratory tests that detect the presence of inflammation, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and/or C-reactive protein (CRP). A test for total immunoglobulins may be used to evaluate a person with SLE and a complement test may be done to monitor the course of the disease."
"If I have one antiphospholipid antibody, will I develop others? ","It is possible, but there is no way to predict when or if this will happen. Antiphospholipid antibody development, and the development of symptoms and complications, varies by individual."
Should everyone be tested for antiphospholipid antibodies?,General screening is not necessary. Testing is usually only performed if a person has associated signs or symptoms or as a follow up to other testing. Most people will never need to have this testing performed.
Can ASO be used to diagnose strep throat?,"ASO levels are not detectable for at least a week after an infection, so ASO tests are not used to diagnose a current, acute infection. A throat culture or a rapid strep test is the best method to diagnose strep throat (streptococcal pharyngitis). It is important that strep throat be promptly identified and treated to avoid complications and passing the infection on to others."
"If I am diagnosed with strep, will an ASO always be performed?","No. In general, the ASO test is only performed when someone has symptoms suggesting that a complication may have developed after a strep infection that was not diagnosed and treated appropriately. Most people do not experience these complications, so the ASO test is not routinely done."
Can the ASO test be performed in my doctor's office?,"Most doctors' offices will not perform this test. Typically, your blood will be sent to a laboratory for testing."
"In addition to ASO, what other testing might be done?","If you healthcare practitioner thinks you have rheumatic fever, you may need other tests such as anti-DNAse B, anti-hyaluronidase or anti-streptozyme."
How can I determine my risk of developing a blood clot?,"If you have a personal or strong family history of recurrent blood clots, your healthcare provider may perform an examination to determine your general state of health and order a series of tests to determine your risk of having an excessive clotting disorder. The more inherited or acquired risk factors you have (such as a factor V leiden or PT 20210 mutation, or a protein C or S deficiency), the higher your relative risk of clotting. This risk can be further increased if you are overweight, sedentary, have hypertension, smoke, and/or take oral contraceptives. It is important to remember, however, that any overall relative risk that is determined is still a statistical risk. No one can predict whether a particular person will actually experience recurrent clotting."
Should I tell my dentist or other healthcare providers about my antithrombin deficiency?,Yes.  This is important information that your healthcare providers should know about as it affects your body's ability to clot appropriately during and after a medical procedure.
Can I do anything to change my antithrombin activity or quantity?,"In general, no. If you have an acquired deficiency that is related to an underlying condition, such as liver disease, then treating the condition may ease or eliminate the deficiency. If needed, your healthcare provider may treat you with antithrombin (as a medication) to temporarily correct the deficiency."
What can I do to lower my apo B?,"Diet and exercise changes that lower LDL levels (and increase HDL, the ""good"" cholesterol) will lower your apo B levels and decrease your risk of heart disease."
What could cause apoB and LDL levels to stay high despite lifestyle changes?,"Some elevations of apo B-100 (and LDL-C) are due to mutations in the APOB gene that cause it to produce apo B-100 that is not recognized as easily by LDL receptors. Others are in the LDL receptor system of the liver cell that recognizes apo B-100. These genetic defects impede the clearing of LDL from the blood and result in accumulations of LDL in the circulation, increasing the risk of heart disease."
Can an apo B test be performed in my doctor's office or at home?,"No, the apo B test requires specialized equipment and is not offered by every laboratory. Your blood may need to be sent to a reference laboratory for testing."
What can I do to raise my apo A-I?,"Behaviors that tend to raise HDL also raise apo A-I. Regular exercise is one of the best ways to raise HDL and apo A-I. By decreasing the saturated fat in your diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and exercising, you can help decrease your risk of developing heart disease."
Can an apo A-I test be performed in my doctor's office or at home?,"No, the apo A-I test requires specialized equipment and is not offered by every laboratory. Your blood may need to be sent to a reference laboratory for testing."
Can this test be done at my local lab?,"APOE genotyping is not available in every laboratory. If a healthcare practitioner recommends this test, the specimen will likely be sent to a reference laboratory and results may take longer to return than they would from a local laboratory."
My father has been diagnosed with probable late onset Alzheimer disease and his APOE genotype test is negative for e4 alleles. Should his doctor be doing other genetic testing?,"No, not at this time. Forty percent of individuals who have late onset Alzheimer disease (AD) are negative for APOE e4 alleles.
Currently, there are only three known genes that are associated with AD. Mutations in each of these genes (PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP) are associated only with a rare and early onset form of AD. Changes to these genes are not associated with typical or late onset AD. If you have a strong family history of AD that includes multiple family members across several generations, you may want to talk to your doctor about genetic counseling for risk assessment."
Should everyone have their APOE genotype tested?,"No, the test is not intended to be used to screen the general population. It is intended to be used in very specific situations to give a healthcare practitioner additional information. The association of APOE's e4 allele with AD arose as part of the Framingham Heart study to evaluate genetic risk factors related to cardiovascular health."
Is there a reason to test for APOE genotype more than once?,"No, not unless your healthcare provider suspects that the first test was in error. A person inherits one copy of the gene from each parent and genotype does not change."
Should everyone have their APOE genotype tested?,"No, the test is not intended to be used to screen the general population. It is intended to be used in very specific situations to give a healthcare practitioner additional information about a possible genetic cause for observed lipid abnormalities."
Is there a reason to test for APOE genotype more than once?,No. A person inherits one copy of the gene from each parent and genotype does not change.
Should everyone be tested for arboviruses?,"In general, there is no need. Most people who become infected have few to mild symptoms and are only exposed to those arboviruses that are present in the areas where they live or travel. Testing is not usually done on asymptomatic people, but when a blood or organ recipient or an infant becomes infected with an arbovirus such as West Nile Virus, antibody testing may be ordered on the asymptomatic donor or mother to help determine whether she was the source of the infection."
Are arboviruses something I should worry about when I travel?,"Every region in the world has its own health concerns and it is prudent to read about the areas where you will be traveling and to talk to your healthcare provider about the risks for infection. There is an increased risk of an arbovirus infection when traveling to a tropical location or to an area that has seasonal outbreaks. A person's likelihood of exposure will be influenced by that person's planned activities and by the preventive measures that the person takes. (For more on the specific diseases related to your travels, visit the Destinations page on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention web site.)"
Are there vaccines for arboviruses?,There is a vaccine for Yellow fever for humans and there are several vaccines for the equine encephalitis viruses that have been developed for horses. Research in this area continues.
Who performs arbovirus testing?,"Depending on the arbovirus that is suspected, testing may be performed by a reference laboratory, your local, state or territorial public health laboratory, or by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
What conditions other than liver problems can cause increased AST?,"Conditions that affect other organs, such as the heart and skeletal muscle, can cause elevations of AST. Mild to moderate increases may be seen with vigorous exercise and skeletal muscle injury or in conditions such as acute pancreatitis and heart attacks."
What other tests may be used to help determine the cause of liver damage?,"After a thorough physical exam and evaluation of a person's medical history, there are several other tests that may be performed as follow up depending on what is suspected to be the cause of liver damage. Some of these include:

Tests for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C
Testing for exposure to drugs and other substances toxic to the liver (see Drug Abuse Testing and Emergency and Overdose Drug Testing)
Ethanol level
Copper and ceruloplasmin for Wilson disease
Iron tests and genetic tests for hereditary hemochromatosis

A liver biopsy may be performed to help determine the cause of liver injury and to evaluate the extent of liver damage.
For more information, see the article on Liver Disease."
What are some other details about B cells?,"B cells contain specific areas (genes) in their DNA that code for the production of antibodies (also known as immunoglobulins).The immunoglobulin genes consist of numerous, discontinuous coding segments. As B cells develop and mature, these DNA segments are rearranged in a controlled fashion such that each mature B cell has a unique rearrangement profile. When the body is exposed to antigen, such as bacteria or viruses, the B-cell immunoglobulin genes undergo a permanent rearrangement in order to produce antibodies directed against that threat. For instance, if a person is exposed to a rubella virus, then some of the B cells change and become rubella antibody-secreting cells. If a person is exposed to a hepatitis B virus, then some of the B cells become hepatitis B antibody-secreting cells.
The body maintains a library of antibody ""blueprints"" so that the next time it is exposed to a threat, it can use the B-cell blueprint to rapidly produce large quantities of a specific antibody. This means that the population of mature B cells is normally diverse (polyclonal) with small amounts of many different kinds of antibodies and temporary increases in specific antibodies as needed to counter an exposure. In this setting, B-cell expansions are polyclonal, with each clone containing relatively few cells and no one clone predominating.
With a B-cell lymphoma, an abnormal B cell is formed and begins to clone itself. The identical, cloned (monoclonal) cells do not function normally, their replication is not controlled by the immune system, and they may not die as normal cells do. A monoclonal population of B cells accumulates, begins to crowd out normal cells, and may eventually spread through the lymphatic system and blood to other lymph nodes or tissue, including bone marrow.
All of the monoclonal B cells produced will have an identical immunoglobulin gene rearrangement profile. The neoplastic clones are generally large, and therefore the clonal cells are the predominant B cells present in involved tissue (e.g., lymph node, bone marrow, blood, body fluid). Detection of a predominant immunoglobulin gene rearrangement profile often indicates the presence of a clonal B-cell population. This can help establish the diagnosis of a B-cell lymphoma or evaluate for residual or recurrent disease after treatment."
Can results of testing be used to determine the course of my cancer?,"No. A positive testing result only helps to confirm a diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma and does not point to a specific subtype of B-cell lymphoma. The clinical course and response to treatment are generally determined by the subtype of a person's lymphoma, along with certain genetic abnormalities."
How common are B-cell gene rearrangements?,"B-cell immunoglobulin genes are constantly rearranging themselves to produce unique immunoglobulins. These rearrangements are normal. The immunoglobulin genes consist of numerous, discontinuous coding segments. As B cells develop and mature, a portion of DNA that contains one full DNA sequence of one of the genes breaks into pieces. After rearrangement, only some of the pieces are kept, which are joined back together in a specific set of steps. To visualize this, imagine that you have a piece of paper with a set of instructions on it, several paragraphs long and containing hundreds of words. Now imagine that you pick and choose words from multiple locations on the page – a sufficient number to form a sentence. Then you get rid of the rest of the words and put together your sentence. You started with a page and ended up with a sentence, but both make sense as you read them and, in this case, both represent ""functional genes."" It is not hard to see that many different sentences could have been constructed from the same set of instructions. In a similar fashion, the B-cell customization process can be used to produce a large number of unique B-cell gene arrangements."
What are the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for B vitamins?,"The RDA for adults, children, and other groups vary by the specific B vitamin. To determine the RDA for a particular vitamin, see the Dietary Reference Intakes tables provided online by the Office of Dietary Supplements."
Can I change my B vitamin levels?,"In general, your body will use the amount of B vitamins that it needs and eliminate any excess from the body. As long as an adequate amount of B vitamins are provided in your diet, blood levels will remain relatively stable. If you are deficient, your healthcare provider may want you to supplement your B vitamins but talk to your provider before taking this step."
Should everyone have their B vitamin levels checked?,Most people have adequate B vitamins and will not need testing unless they develop a condition that puts them at risk of a B vitamin deficiency.
Can B vitamins be measured at home or in my doctor's office?,"In general, no. These are specialized tests that need to be performed in a laboratory and may need to be sent to a reference laboratory."
Why would my healthcare practitioner collect more than one sample?,"This may be done to increase the chance of detecting the pathogen or to detect multiple pathogens. It may involve multiple swabs, a combination of swabs, fluid aspiration, and/or tissue biopsy, or distinct aerobic and anaerobic sample collection."
"Once I have been treated, can my infection return? ","Most infections will resolve, but if there is still damaged tissue present or a break in the skin’s protection, then there is the potential for another infection to occur.  In some cases, it may take extended treatment and/or a change in medication to resolve an infection."
Why might one person get an infection and another person not?,"Anyone can get a wound infection, but the risk increases with age and with underlying conditions, such as diabetes, that compromise blood flow or the immune system and/or that inhibit healing."
I had a boil on my arm and the healthcare practitioner did not do a culture of the material when he drained it. Why not?,"In a healthy person, the clinical presentation may give the healthcare practitioner sufficient information to treat the infection. With an abscess or boil, the most important treatment is incision and drainage, and antibiotics may not be required. However, if your wound does not heal or it worsens after drainage, you may have an infection with an organism that requires antibiotic therapy tailored to the specific pathogen. In this case, a wound culture should be done to identify the pathogen and perform susceptibility testing to guide treatment."
Are these tests always run as a panel?,"No. Each of these tests may be ordered individually. However, if healthcare practitioners are interested in monitoring two or more individual BMP components, they may order the entire BMP because it offers more information. Alternatively, they may order individual tests when monitoring specific conditions."
How is the BMP different than the CMP and why would my doctor order one over the other?,"The BMP typically includes 8 tests. The comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) usually includes 14 tests – the 8 from the BMP as well as 2 protein tests (albumin and total protein) and 4 liver tests (ALP, ALT, AST, and bilirubin). Your healthcare provider may order a CMP rather than a BMP if the practitioner wants to get a more complete picture of the health of your organs or to check for specific conditions, such as diabetes or liver disease or kidney disease."
One of the results from my BMP is slightly out of range. What does this mean?,"The results of your BMP are interpreted by your healthcare provider within the context of other tests that you have had done as well as other factors, such as your medical history. A single result that is slightly high or low may or may not have medical significance. There are several reasons why a test result may differ on different days and why it may fall outside a designated reference range.

Biological variability (different results in the same person at different times): If a healthcare practitioner runs the same test on you on several different occasions, there's a good chance that one result will fall outside a reference range even though you are in good health. For biological reasons, your values can vary from day to day.
Individual variability (differences in results between different people): References ranges are usually established by collecting results from a large population and determining from the data an expected average (mean) result and expected differences from that average (standard deviation). There are individuals who are healthy but whose tests results, which are normal for them, do not always fall within the expected range of the overall population.

Thus, a test value that falls outside of the established reference range supplied by the laboratory may mean nothing significant. Generally, this is the case when the test value is only slightly higher or lower than the reference range and this is why a healthcare practitioner may repeat a test for you and why the practitioner may look at results from prior times when you had the same test performed.
However, a result outside the range may indicate a problem and warrant further investigation. Your healthcare provider will evaluate your test results in the context of your medical history, physical examination, and other relevant factors to determine whether a result that falls outside of the reference range means something significant for you.
For more, read the articles on Reference Ranges and What They Mean and How Reliable is Laboratory Testing?"
Why would a chromosome analysis be done more than once?,Your health care provider may order chromosome analysis periodically to determine if you have developed any additional chromosome abnormalities. Additional changes are often seen with disease progression and acceleration.
"If I have the Philadelphia chromosome and BCR-ABL1 gene, should my close family members be tested?",No. This genetic change is one that is acquired during a person's lifetime and is not inherited.
Should everyone with leukemia be tested?,"Testing is only indicated when your health practitioner suspects that you have chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), or another rare form of leukemia, or wants to rule them out. The majority of people with leukemia will not have the Philadelphia chromosome and BCR-ABL1 fusion gene."
What is the difference between chronic myelogenous leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia?,They are two terms for the same condition and both are referred to as CML.
"If I have antiphospholipid antibodies, will I definitely develop blood clots? ","Not necessarily. The antibodies increase your risk of blood clots but that does not mean you will have blood clots. And, if you do develop a clot, the presence of the antibodies cannot predict the frequency or severity of clotting."
Should I tell a new healthcare practitioner that I have antiphospholipid antibodies?,"Yes, this is an important part of your medical history. Your healthcare provider needs this information even if you don't have symptoms in order to tailor any procedures or medical treatment plans around this risk factor. "
What are tumor markers?,"Tumor markers are substances, often proteins, that are produced by the cancer tissue itself or sometimes by the body in response to cancer growth. Because some of these substances can be detected in body samples such as blood, urine, and tissue, these markers may be used, along with other tests and procedures, to help detect and diagnose some types of cancer, predict and monitor a person's response to certain treatments, and detect recurrence."
Can I choose either a blood or a urine B2M test?,"In most cases, the sample tested will be dictated by the reason that the test is being performed. For staging of multiple myeloma, a blood test is preferred. Otherwise, it may be necessary to do a blood test, a urine test, or both together. The results are not generally interchangeable."
My bicarbonate level is only slightly out of range. What does this mean?,"Your bicarbonate result is interpreted by your healthcare practitioner within the context of other tests that you have had done as well as other factors, such as your medical history. A single high or low result may or may not have medical significance. Generally, this is the case when the test value is only slightly higher or lower than the reference range. This is why healthcare practitioners may repeat a test on you and why they may look at results from prior times when you had the same test performed.
On the other hand, a result outside the range may indicate a problem and warrant further investigation. Your healthcare practitioner will evaluate your test results and determine whether a result that falls outside of the reference range means something significant for you."
"If I've had a bicarbonate (total CO2) test, why does my healthcare practitioner want to test my blood gases?","Blood gas tests, in which blood is drawn from an artery instead of a vein, can give your healthcare practitioner more information about your acid-base balance. They can tell your provider whether your lungs are working properly to keep oxygen and carbon dioxide at healthy levels."
"If bicarbonate levels are too high or low, what treatments can help?","If your bicarbonate is high or low, your healthcare practitioner will identify and treat the underlying cause. For example, high bicarbonate may be caused by emphysema, which may be treated with oxygen therapy and medications, or by severe diarrhea or vomiting, which would be addressed by treating the cause of the diarrhea or vomiting. Low bicarbonate may be caused by diabetic ketoacidosis, for example, which can be addressed in part by fluid and electrolyte replacement and insulin therapy."
Is there a urine test for bilirubin?,"Yes. Bilirubin testing is included as part of the common dipstick tests used in a routine urinalysis. Bilirubin is not normally present in the urine. However, conjugated bilirubin is water-soluble and may be eliminated from the body through the urine if it cannot pass into the bile. If bilirubin is detected in the urine, it usually means your liver or bile ducts are blocked or you have hepatitis or some other form of liver damage. In these cases, bilirubin may be detectable in the urine early in the disease."
Do some people have an inherited (genetic) risk of abnormal bilirubin levels?,"Yes, several inherited chronic conditions can increase bilirubin levels in the blood. These include:

Gilbert syndrome
Dubin-Johnson syndrome
Rotor syndrome
Crigler-Najjar syndrome

The first three are usually mild, chronic conditions that can be aggravated under certain conditions but in general cause no significant health problems. For example, Gilbert syndrome is very common; about 1 in every 6 people has this genetic abnormality, but usually people with Gilbert syndrome do not have elevated bilirubin. Crigler-Najjar syndrome is the most serious inherited condition listed; this disorder is relatively rare, and some people with it may die."
How do you treat abnormal bilirubin levels and/or jaundice?,"Treatment depends on the cause of the jaundice. In newborns, phototherapy (special light therapy), blood exchange transfusion, and/or certain drugs may be used to reduce the bilirubin level. In Gilbert, Rotor, and Dubin-Johnson syndromes, no treatment is usually necessary. Crigler-Najjar syndrome may respond to certain enzyme drug therapy or may require a liver transplant. Jaundice caused by an obstruction is often resolved by surgery. Jaundice due to cirrhosis is a result of long-term liver damage and does not respond well to any type of therapy other than liver transplantation."
Why can blood culture results take so long?,"The bacteria or fungi must grow to sufficient numbers in the nutrient media before they can be detected and identified. Usually this happens within a couple of days, but in some cases and with some microbes, it can take longer. Furthermore, some microbes are present in the blood in very small numbers. They must have sufficient time to reproduce and grow to quantities that can be detected."
My doctor ordered more blood cultures after the initial cultures were drawn. Why?,"Additional blood cultures may be drawn to determine if bacteria present in the culture are persistent in the bloodstream (true pathogens). If they are not present in follow-up cultures, then bacteria from the skin may have contaminated the initial cultures. Additional blood cultures may also be drawn if you continue to have signs of sepsis but no microbe is recovered from the first cultures collected."
Can this test be done in a doctor's office?,"Blood gas analysis, performed by trained personnel, is usually done in a hospital, emergency room, surgical center, ambulance, or large laboratory setting because it should be performed immediately after sample collection and specialized equipment is required. Most doctors' offices do not have such capabilities."
I've had pneumonia before and currently have asthma. Why has my doctor never ordered this test for me?,"Most cases of pneumonia or asthma can be diagnosed by symptoms and monitored by listening to your chest sounds or by examining the results of spirometry tests or chest x-rays. Most of the time, asthma will respond to prescribed medications and pneumonia will respond to rest and possibly antibiotics. Blood gas analysis may be necessary, however, if you have severe or acute breathing problems or prolonged, chronic ones. In these cases, blood gas analysis is usually done in an emergency room or hospital setting."
Is there any other way to measure my oxygen levels?,"A pulse oximeter is a noninvasive way (no needlestick or blood sample required) of continuously monitoring O2 saturation. A small clip-like device (sensor) is attached to the end of the finger or earlobe. The sensor reads light that is transmitted through the skin. Pulse oximeters are useful for monitoring trends in O2 saturation, but their accuracy can be affected by the presence of abnormal forms of hemoglobin, like carboxyhemoglobin (see below), low blood pressure due to poor perfusion (pumping of blood into an organ or tissue), and very low levels of hemoglobin due to severe anemia."
"If I have diabetes, can I just test for glucose instead of ketones? ","They are related but not the same thing. While increases in ketones are associated with high glucose concentrations, they can also occur with moderate glucose levels in many conditions, such as when you are sick."
Can I test for ketones in my urine instead of my blood? ,"In many cases, yes, urine is tested much more frequently than blood. However, since it will not detect beta-hydroxybutyrate, the main ketone body with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), your healthcare provider may prefer that you monitor your blood."
Can I get diabetic ketoacidosis if I have type 2 diabetes? ,"Yes, although it is not as common as in type 1 diabetes. It may occur in type 2 diabetes, especially when you have a severe infection or illness. Ketosis and ketoacidosis may also be seen in people without diabetes, such as people with prolonged starvation, alcoholism, and with high-fat, low-carbohydrate diets (keto diets). It may be induced on purpose in some children with epilepsy who have frequent seizures and do not respond to available medications or other treatments."
Can I have ketosis or ketoacidosis and not know it? ,"You could have some degree of ketosis with few symptoms, but the accumulation of ketones triggers the symptoms, so they would emerge as concentrations increase."
How is the blood smear used?,"A blood smear is often used as a follow-up test to abnormal results on a complete blood count (CBC) to evaluate the different types of blood cells. It may be used to help diagnose and/or monitor numerous conditions that affect blood cell populations.
At one time, a blood smear was prepared on nearly everyone who had a CBC. With the development of more sophisticated, automated blood cell counting instruments, it has now become routine to provide an automated differential. However, if the results from an automated cell count and/or differential indicate the presence of immature, atypical, or abnormal white blood cells (WBCs), red blood cells (RBCs), and/or platelets or if there is reason to suspect that abnormal cells are present, then a blood smear may be performed.
A blood smear is often used to categorize and/or identify conditions that affect one or more type of blood cells and to monitor individuals undergoing treatment for these conditions. There are many diseases, disorders, and deficiencies that can affect the number and type of blood cells produced, their function, and their lifespan. Examples include anemia, myeloproliferative neoplasms, bone marrow disorders, and leukemia.
Usually, only normal, mature or nearly mature cells are released into the bloodstream, but certain circumstances can induce the bone marrow to release immature and/or abnormal cells into the circulation. When a significant number or type of abnormal cells are present, it can suggest a disease or condition and prompt a healthcare practitioner to do further testing."
"If my blood smear shows abnormal results, what additional testing might be done? ","Depending on the findings from the CBC and blood smear and the condition that your healthcare practitioner suspects, follow-up testing may include tests such as:

Iron tests
Vitamin B12 and folate tests 
Flow cytometry immunophenotyping
Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy 
BCR-ABL1 
Hemoglobinopathy evaluation"
Why hasn't the automated blood cell counter totally replaced the blood smear?,"It has on a routine basis, but the automated blood cell counter usually evaluates the red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets based on their shape, size, and electrical or photometric properties. There can be some variation in each cell type and numbers the body produces. Use of an automated instrument can often identify the presence of abnormal cells but lacks the ability to definitively subclassify them. Cell fragments and platelet clumps, particularly if they are large in size, can be mistakenly counted as WBCs, thus falsely elevating a white cell count. A laboratorian can see these abnormalities on a blood smear and has been trained to identify and classify them appropriately.
Traditionally, blood smear review/interpretation has been done manually using a microscope, which is time-consuming. Automated digital morphology systems are now available to help analyze blood smears more efficiently."
"If a drop of blood on a slide contains millions of RBCs, thousands of WBCs, and hundreds of thousands of platelets, how can the laboratorian see individual cells?","A specific technique is used to spread the drop of blood out across a glass slide into a ""thumbprint"" shape. Along the edges of this thumbprint the cells are only a single layer thick. This allows the cells in this area to be individually counted and evaluated under the microscope."
Do I need to know my blood type?,"If you need a transfusion, healthcare practitioners at your healthcare facility will determine your blood type before they give you any blood. The only time you would not get a blood type test is in an extreme emergency and there is not enough time to type your blood. In this case, you would receive group O since this blood type does not have any A or B antigens that can potentially cause a hemolytic transfusion reaction. The use of Rh-negative blood depends upon the situation and the supply of O negative blood in the area."
Who are universal blood donors and recipients?,"Universal blood donors have type O, Rh negative blood. This means they have no A or B antigens or Rh factor on their red blood cells to which the recipient's antibodies can react. Recipients of their red blood cells have little risk of a hemolytic transfusion reaction due to ABO or Rh incompatibility.
Universal recipients have type AB, Rh positive blood. They recognize A, B and Rh antigens as ""self"" and can receive red blood cells of any ABO or Rh type with no risk of a serious hemolytic transfusion reaction due to ABO or Rh incompatibility."
"Besides ABO and Rh, are there other types of red blood cell antigens?","Yes, numerous other antigens can be present on the surface of red blood cells. These other RBC blood group antigens include, for example, Kell, Kidd, Duffy, and other Rh antigens. The body does not produce antibodies to these antigens unless it is exposed to these antigens through blood transfusion or during pregnancy. These antibodies are not detected during routine blood typing but may be found with an RBC antibody screen. For more on these antigens and antibodies, see the article on RBC Antibody Identification."
My BUN result is slightly out of range. What does this mean?,"Your BUN result is interpreted by your healthcare provider within the context of other tests that you have had done as well as other factors, such as your medical history. A single result that is slightly high or low may or may not have medical significance. This is why a healthcare practitioner may repeat a test on you and why they may look at results from prior times when you had the same test performed.
However, a result outside the range may indicate a problem and warrant further investigation. Your healthcare provider will evaluate your test results in the context of other relevant factors to determine whether a result that falls outside of the reference range means something significant for you.
For more, read the article Reference Ranges and What They Mean."
What other tests are used with the blood urea nitrogen test to check how my kidneys are functioning?,"BUN and creatinine are the primary tests used to check how well the kidneys are able to filter waste products from your blood.  Your healthcare provider may also order other tests to evaluate kidney function. Examples include:

Renal panel
Urine protein—a few different tests may be used to screen for protein in the urine:
	
Urine albumin and albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR)—these detect small amounts of albumin in the urine, which may indicate kidney dysfunction.
Urinalysis—this is a routine test that can detect protein in the urine as well as red blood cells and white blood cells. These are not normally found in the urine and, if present, may indicate kidney disease.
Urine total protein or urine protein to creatinine ratio (UP/CR)—detects not just albumin, but all types of proteins that may be present in the urine.


Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)— a calculation based on the results of a blood creatinine test or a cystatin C test, along with other variables such as age, sex, and race (e.g., African-American, non-African American), depending on the equation used. The glomerular filtration rate refers to the amount of blood that is filtered by the glomeruli per minute. As kidney function declines, the filtration rate decreases."
How does BUN change with age?,"BUN levels increase with age. BUN levels in very young babies are about 2/3 of the levels found in healthy young adults, while levels in adults over 60 years of age are slightly higher than younger adults."
How common is heart failure?,"According to the American Heart Association, more than 6 million people in the United States are living with heart failure and the number is growing. It is estimated that one in five American adults age 40 and older will develop heart failure in their lifetime. You may be at increased risk of developing heart failure if you have conditions such as heart disease, high blood pressure, or diabetes, or if you have had a heart attack. Other risk factors include tobacco use, alcohol use, and obesity."
Should everyone have bone marker testing performed?,Bone marker testing is typically only indicated for those who have been diagnosed with or are at risk of bone loss. The tests are not intended to be used to screen the general public. They offer additional information but do not take the place of bone mineral density screening.
Will I have all or just some of these bone markers tested?,"Typically, no one will have all of the tests done that are described here. Most healthcare practitioners use one or a few particular bone markers, including one or two that evaluate bone resorption and one or two that evaluate bone formation. The choice of bone markers will depend on many factors, including your medical history, signs and symptoms, and physical examination, and these all vary from person to person. Your healthcare practitioner will make the selection based on the usefulness of the tests for your condition. In general, if a test is ordered as a baseline prior to therapy, then the same test will be ordered later so that the two results can be compared."
Can testing be performed in my healthcare practitioner's office?,"In general, no. While a blood or urine sample may be collected in your healthcare practitioner's office, the sample will be sent to a laboratory for testing. Bone marker testing is not offered by all laboratories and will often be sent to a reference laboratory."
What can I do to increase or decrease bone marker results?,"People can and should take steps to maintain bone health throughout their life, but bone markers themselves are not affected by lifestyle changes. If you have bone loss, work with your healthcare practitioner to determine the best treatment for you."
Will I be given general anesthesia for a bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy?,"While you will be given a local anesthetic, an injection to numb the area of the collection site, general anesthesia is not usually necessary for adults (although it is common for children). However, you may be given a sedative before the procedure."
How does a bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy compare with a bone marrow collection for donation?,"Nowadays, instead of a bone marrow collection for donation, donors of hematopoietic stem cells are usually given a medication that stimulates their bone marrow to release immature cells into the blood, and those cells are collected in a process very similar to a normal blood donation. After processing, the stem cells in the donor sample are infused into the recipient and travel through the bloodstream to the recipient's marrow spaces and, if all goes right, begin to produce red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets."
"If my results are negative, does that mean I don't have increased risk of breast or ovarian cancer?","Genetic testing for pathogenic BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations cannot detect 100% of these mutations. Thus, even with a negative result, there is very small chance that there is a pathogenic BRCA1/2 gene mutation present that was not identified by the testing. This is sometimes called your residual risk. In addition, there are other genes that may have pathogenic mutations that can contribute to a family's risk for breast cancer or other cancers. Genetic testing for just BRCA1/2 will only detect pathogenic mutations in these two genes. Therefore, if a mutation is present in another gene known to cause an increased risk for breast cancer, BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene testing will not detect it. If a pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutation has been found in your family because a relative has already had testing, and you then test negative for this variant, your residual risk is lower than if the variant in your family was not known. No test will take your risk to zero, but it may be described to you as similar to the risk in the general population.
In addition, sometimes a personal or family history of cancer may suggest a factor or combination of other factors that can contribute to risk. In these families, it is likely that common risk factors such as multiple shared genes that only sometimes cause cancer (low penetrance), shared environment and exposures, and shared lifestyle habits are increasing the risk for cancer above that of the general population. While members of these families typically do not have increased risks as high as those seen in individuals with pathogenic BRCA1/2 gene mutations, they often will have increased risks for cancer slightly above those of the general population and sometimes increased cancer surveillance is recommended."
Are people with BRCA mutations at risk for other cancers?,"The BRCA gene's role in cancer risk is an active area of research. In addition to breast and ovarian cancer, the mutations have been linked to prostate and pancreatic cancer. A 2016 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found BRCA1/2 gene variants in 11.8% of men with metastatic prostate cancer, compared with 2.7% of men without a cancer diagnosis. Citing this study, in 2019 the National Comprehensive Cancer Network updated its recommendations to include considering genetic testing for all men with high-risk, very high-risk, regional or metastatic prostate cancer, as well as those with a family history of prostate cancer or Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Experts also recommend that men carrying BRCA2 genetic variant begin prostate cancer screening at 40 years old.
Additionally, in both men and women, a BRCA genetic variant increases the risk of developing pancreatic cancer to 5%, compared with 1% for the average person. In 2020, the American Gastroenterological Association updated its guidelines to state that genetic testing and counseling should be considered for people who have family members with pancreatic cancer and that pancreatic cancer screening in high-risk individuals should begin at age 50."
"If I have a positive result, should I tell my family members?","Positive test results (pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants identified) may have implications for other family members. When one member of a family is tested for pathogenic BRCA mutations, issues often arise about how to share this information with other family members. It may be helpful to seek advice from a genetic counselor about how to communicate results with other family members."
Should I have genetic counseling before or after I get tested?,"Consultation with a genetic counselor about genetic testing both before and after you get tested cannot be overemphasized. There are many issues to be considered when preparing for a genetic test and upon learning the results, and a genetic counselor has the knowledge and expertise to help you sort through them."
"Besides breast and ovarian cancer risk assessment, is BRCA1/2 testing used for anything else?","Yes, BRCA1/2 testing may be used if a person already has cancer to see if they will respond to targeted therapy. In recent years, cancer drugs have been developed that target specific genetic changes (mutations) in tumors. Testing for the particular mutation that the drug targets can help predict who may benefit from the drug and who is not likely to respond. BRCA1/2 testing may be used to determine who will benefit from targeted drugs used to treat, for example, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, or pancreatic cancer. A blood sample or a sample of your tumor may be requested for testing."
Can I do a C-peptide test at home like I can when I check my blood glucose?,No. The C-peptide test requires special equipment and training to perform.
"If I need to go on the insulin pump, will I need a C-peptide test?",You may. Insulin pumps may be desirable or recommended for certain people with diabetes who require regular insulin injections. Some insurance plans may require C-peptide results prior to approval of coverage for insulin pumps.
What else is known about C-peptide?,"Researchers are starting to better understand the role of C-peptide in the body. Some studies have been conducted to evaluate the use of C-peptide in conjunction with insulin for those with diabetes. Results have been promising, showing decreased diabetic complications with improvements in kidney function, blood flow, and nerve function. However, further studies are needed."
What are chronic inflammatory diseases?,"""Chronic inflammatory diseases"" is a general term used to describe long-lasting or frequently recurring bouts of inflammation associated with a more specific disease. Chronic inflammation can be caused by a number of different conditions such as arthritis, lupus, or inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis)."
What is the difference between CRP and hs-CRP tests?,"Both tests are essentially the same, measuring the same substance in the blood. However, the high sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) test measures very small amounts of CRP in the blood and is ordered most frequently for seemingly healthy people to assess their potential risk for heart problems. It typically measures CRP in the range from 0.3 to 10 mg/L. The regular CRP test is ordered for those at risk for infections or chronic inflammatory diseases (see above). It measures CRP in the range from 8 to 1000 mg/L (or 0.8 to 100 mg/dL)."
What can I do to lower my CRP level?,Make sure to follow the instructions or recommendations of your healthcare provider. CRP levels generally drop down when infection is resolved with treatment.
Can a CRP test be performed in my doctor's office?,"It may be performed in a larger clinic, but most CRP tests will be performed in a laboratory."
Why isn’t CA-125 used to screen for ovarian cancer?,"Because CA-125 can be high in many normal or benign conditions, such as pregnancy, menstruation, endometriosis, and pelvic inflammatory disease, it is not useful or recommended as a screening test for the general population."
Are there other tumor markers used in ovarian cancer?,"A new tumor marker, human epididymis protein 4 (HE4), may be ordered along with CA-125 to monitor epithelial cell tumors, the most common type of ovarian cancers. These cancers develop from the cells that cover the outside of the ovaries. The use and full clinical utility of this test has yet to be determined."
Is CA-125 always increased in ovarian cancer?,"No, not all ovarian cancers are associated with increased levels of CA-125. Elevated levels have been found in about 80% of women with ovarian cancer."
Does ovarian cancer run in families?,"Family history is a risk factor for ovarian cancer. If you have close family members who have had ovarian cancer, you are at higher risk than someone who has no family history of the disease. Make sure your healthcare providers know about your family medical history. Women who have inherited a mutation in one of the BRCA genes are at high risk of ovarian cancer. For more details, see the article on BRCA Gene Mutation Testing."
What are some other risk factors for ovarian cancer?,"In addition to family history, other risk factors include increasing age, obesity, and use of hormone replacement therapy. See the American Cancer Society website for more on this."
Should I have a test for CA 27.29 in addition to the CA 15-3 test?,"No. Although it has a different name, the CA 27.29 test measures the same protein as CA 15-3 and is used in the same way. It can be used instead of CA 15-3, but you don't need both tests."
I have a strong family history of breast cancer. Shouldn't I be screened for CA 15-3?,"CA 15-3 is not recommended as a screening tool. It is not specific or sensitive enough to detect early breast cancer. Elevations in CA 15-3 may be due to other causes, and a normal value does not ensure that you do not have cancer. As a rule, it should only be used after breast cancer has been diagnosed."
Are calcitonin levels elevated in other conditions besides c-cell hyperplasia and medullary thyroid cancer?,"Yes. Calcitonin levels may be elevated with lung, breast, and pancreatic cancers, insulinomas, and rare pancreatic tumors called VIPomas (associated with vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) hormone production).
Other conditions with elevated calcitonin include:

Intestinal, gastric, or bronchial carcinoid tumors
Chronic renal failure
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome
Pernicious anemia"
Why isn’t calcitonin testing performed as a routine screen?,C-cell hyperplasia and medullary thyroid cancer are both sufficiently rare that it is not useful to screen for calcitonin in the general population.
"If my thyroid is removed, will I need to replace my calcitonin?","No, the body can function without it. However, you will need lifelong thyroid hormone (usually T4) replacement therapy. This is manufactured thyroid hormone taken as a pill by mouth that replaces your body's own thyroid hormone."
Is calcitonin ever used as a supplement?,"Yes, but in a totally different context. Because it inhibits bone breakdown (resorption) when given in very large doses, calcitonin is sometimes given as a drug to people who have osteoporosis. It helps maintain bone density and has a pain-relieving effect on bone. The supplement is usually administered as an injection or nasal spray. Calcitonin is a protein and will be broken down by digestion, becoming inactive, so it cannot be taken by mouth."
Should I be concerned if my doctor only orders a total calcium test and not free or ionized calcium?,"No. Measuring total calcium is usually sufficient for screening purposes. The total calcium test is more easily performed than the ionized calcium test since it requires no special handling of the blood sample.
The ionized calcium test requires specialized handling and expedited delivery of the blood sample to the laboratory for prompt analysis. The necessary handling and delivery is difficult to achieve outside of a hospital setting.
In most cases, total calcium is a good substitute for free calcium since the free and bound forms are usually each about half of the total.
The direct measurement of ionized calcium is particularly important during surgery as well as in severely ill patients, when changes in total calcium do not reliably tell how abnormal the ionized calcium level is."
What foods are high in calcium?,"Dairy products are the main source of calcium, but lesser amounts are found in eggs, green leafy vegetables, broccoli, legumes, nuts, and whole grains. Many fruit juices are now fortified with calcium."
"If I consume foods fortified with calcium, would it change my laboratory results?","In general, consuming fortified foods will not directly affect your calcium test results. Talk to your healthcare provider about your calcium requirements to help determine whether you should be taking calcium and/or vitamin supplements."
Can I perform this test at home?,"No. While there are hand-held instruments available, these are intended for use in a hospital or medical office setting and must be operated by trained personnel."
Can a blood test be substituted for a stool calprotectin test?,"In general, no. There are blood tests used to detect inflammation (CRP, ESR), but they do not provide the same information about gastrointestinal inflammation as the stool calprotectin test."
What can I do to decrease my calprotectin?,"Calprotectin is a reflection of gastrointestinal inflammation and is not affected by lifestyle changes. If it is due to an infection, then it will most likely return to normal when the infection resolves. If it is due to inflammatory bowel disease, then it will rise and fall with disease activity. In the rare case that an elevated calprotectin is caused by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy, then it is likely to return to normal when the medication is discontinued."
How long will it take for my calprotectin results?,That depends on the laboratory performing the test. This test is somewhat specialized and is not offered by all laboratories. Your sample will likely be sent to a reference laboratory for testing and it may take several days before results are available.
Is the CALR mutation hereditary?,"No, the CALR mutation associated with MPNs is somatic, meaning it is acquired during cell division and is not passed on to children."
Can this test be done in my healthcare practitioner's office?,CALR mutation testing must be done in a laboratory that performs molecular testing. It is not offered by every laboratory and must often be sent out to a reference laboratory.
How long does it take for CALR mutation test results?,Test results can take several days to two weeks to arrive.
Are there other genetic mutations associated with MPNs?,"Yes, JAK2 mutations are found in more than 95% of polycythemia vera (PV) cases. JAK2 mutations are also associated with 50-60% of cases of essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). In addition, mutations in the myeloproliferative leukemia (MPL) gene are seen in a small percentage of adult ET and PMF patients, but not with PV. If someone carries the CALR mutation, that person will not carry JAK2 or MPL mutations, i.e., they are mutually exclusive. PV, ET and PMF are all rare in children and adolescents and although mutations might not be as common as in adults with these same diseases, not much is known. Genetic testing is also sometimes used to check for the presence or absence of a Philadelphia (Ph') chromosome or a BCR-ABL1 translocation in a person suspected of having chronic myeloid leukemia."
Is it important to use the same lab each time I have a CA 19-9 test done?,"Yes. Laboratories may use different methods to test for CA 19-9, so results can vary from lab to lab. If you are having a series of CA 19-9 tests done, it is advised that you have the tests done by the same method, typically by the same laboratory, so that the results can be compared and interpreted correctly. You may wish to discuss this issue with your healthcare practitioner."
Why is my healthcare practitioner not screening me for CA 19-9?,CA 19-9 is not sensitive or specific enough to be recommended as a screen for people who do not have symptoms. There are too many false positives and false negatives associated with it. Researchers are looking for other markers that may help detect pancreatic cancer at an earlier stage and that may be more suitable for screening.
What other procedures will my healthcare practitioner likely order along with CA 19-9?,"Your healthcare practitioner may order a CT scan (computed tomography), an ultrasound, an MRI scan to look at the pancreatic and bile ducts, and/or an ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, a procedure in which a small lighted tube is passed through the mouth and stomach into the duodenum and then into the bile and pancreatic ducts). For more details on this, see RadiologyInfo.org. Your healthcare practitioner may also order a biopsy to look for cancer cells under the microscope."
What are the main risk factors for pancreatic cancer?,"Healthcare practitioners still do not know what causes most cases of pancreatic cancer. Identified risk factors include tobacco use (smoking and smokeless products), age (most are over 50 years old), sex (men are slightly more likely to have it than women), family history, diabetes, chronic pancreatitis, and workplace exposure to certain chemicals, such those used in the dry cleaning and metal working businesses."
"If I am a smoker, does an elevated CEA level mean I have cancer?",Not necessarily. Smokers can have CEA values up to twice the normal range for non-smokers and not have cancer.
Will every person with cancer have a CEA test performed?,"No. CEA has a role to play in certain tumors, particularly colon cancer. However, a number of other tumor markers have been developed to monitor cancers from different areas of the body. As an example, breast cancer is usually monitored with a CA 15-3 test or a CA 27.29 test. For some cancers, testing for tumor markers is not done at all."
Are there any side effects of performing a CEA test?,"A CEA blood test typically has no associated risk. Very mild pain and bruising may occur at the site where blood was collected using a needle. To assess metastasis, fluid can be collected from other sites. For example, pleural fluid may be collected from the area surrounding the lungs. This procedure has a small risk of lung injury, bleeding, or infection. When peritoneal fluid (the liquid in the abdomen filling the sacs surrounding the intestine) is collected to assess abdominal metastasis, there may be a small risk of damage to the intestine or other organs. You may also feel pain and dizziness after the procedure. To assess brain metastasis, CSF will be collected by a spinal tap (lumbar puncture) to measure the CEA. With this procedure, back pain or tenderness at the needle insertion might happen, and a post lumbar headache or dizziness might occur."
"If I have cardiolipin antibodies, will I definitely develop blood clots?","Not necessarily. The cardiolipin antibodies represent a risk factor, but they cannot predict whether an individual person will have recurrent blood clots or other associated complications. And, if a person does have blood clots, the presence of the antibodies cannot predict their frequency or severity."
Should I tell a new healthcare provider that I have cardiolipin antibodies?,"Yes, this is an important part of your medical history. Your healthcare providers need this information, even if you are asymptomatic, so that they can tailor any procedures or medical treatment plans around this risk factor."
Is it really necessary to collect urine for 24 hours?,"Yes, for accurate test results it is essential that all of the urine be collected. Catecholamines are released in varying amounts at varying times, so the one sample not included might be the one with the most hormones in it. For general instructions, read about the 24-hour urine collection."
Can my state of mind really affect my test results?,"Yes, because catecholamines are released from the adrenal glands in response to stress. If you are anxious or afraid, your catecholamines levels may be increased."
How is HIV infection diagnosed?,"HIV infection is usually screened for with a test for HIV antibody and antigen (p24). If the screening test is positive, it must be followed with another test, such as a second antibody test that can differentiate HIV-1 and HIV-2. If results of the first and second test do not agree, then an HIV-1 RNA test (nucleic acid amplification test, NAAT) is performed. If either the second antibody test or the HIV-1 RNA is positive, then you are diagnosed with HIV infection. Read the article on HIV Antibody and HIV Antigen (p24) for more details."
What are some common opportunistic infections I might get if I have an HIV infection?,"Opportunistic infections are those that occur more frequently in people who have a weakened immune system. For people infected with HIV, a CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm3 puts you at risk for opportunistic infections, including pneumocystis pneumonia, toxoplasma encephalitis, cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, tuberculosis and disseminated infections caused by nontuberculosis mycobacteria, cryptococcal meningitis, as well as candidiasis and other fungal infections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides a table with examples of common opportunistic infections. Viral suppression virtually eliminates this risk."
What are my treatment options?,"In general, treatment is recommended regardless of whether the CD4 count is low or within the normal range. You and your healthcare provider should discuss your treatment options to determine what will work best for you. The Mayo Clinic web page HIV/AIDS: Treatments and drugs has detailed information on various therapies."
Is a CD4 cell count used in conditions other than HIV infection?,"Yes. It may be ordered when a person has had an organ transplant to help evaluate the effect of immunosuppressive medications. In transplantation, the immune system must be suppressed so that it does not attack the transplanted organ and cause rejection. In this case, it is desirable to have low levels of CD4 cells, and a decreased count shows that the drug is working. A CD4 count may be repeated periodically to monitor the effectiveness of therapy.
CD4 counts are sometimes done in conjunction with CD8 counts. CD8 cells are another type of lymphocyte called T-suppressor cell or cytotoxic T cell. CD8 cells identify and kill cells that have been infected with viruses or that have been affected by cancer.
Evaluation of CD4 and CD8 cells may be used to help classify lymphomas. Typically, several markers on the surface of lymphocytes in addition to CD4 and CD8 are evaluated. The tests help determine whether the lymphoma is due to the proliferation of B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes and which specific type. This information is useful in determining appropriate therapy.
These tests may also help diagnose DiGeorge syndrome, a rare congenital disorder characterized by, among other things, low levels of T cells in the blood. For more information on DiGeorge syndrome, visit the Mayo Clinic web site."
"Besides antibody tests, what other tests may be ordered?","Additional tests may be ordered to help determine the severity of the disease and the extent of the complications a person may experience, such as malnutrition, malabsorption, and the involvement of other organs. Examples include:

Anti-F-actin — may sometimes be ordered if a person has been diagnosed with celiac disease and a healthcare practitioner wants to evaluate the severity of intestinal damage; a positive result may indicate increased intestinal damage.
CBC (complete blood count) to look for anemia
CRP (C-Reactive protein) to evaluate inflammation
CMP (comprehensive metabolic panel) to determine electrolyte, protein, and calcium levels, and to verify the status of the kidney and liver
Vitamin D and B12 and folate to detect vitamin deficiencies
Iron, iron binding capacity or transferrin, and ferritin to detect iron deficiency
Stool fat, to help evaluate malabsorption
	 

Since those with celiac disease may also experience conditions such as lactose intolerance, celiac tests may be done in conjunction with other intolerance and allergy testing. "
What is the difference between celiac disease and an allergy to wheat and other grains?,"Allergies involve hypersensitivity reactions and the production of specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies directed against grains such as wheat and rye. These antibodies may cause some symptoms similar to those caused by celiac disease, but they will only do so for a short time after you eat the food to which you are allergic. The reaction may be mild or severe, but it is limited and does not cause damage to the lining of your intestine the way that celiac disease does. If you feel that you may have a wheat or other grain allergy, talk to your healthcare practitioner about getting tested for these allergen-specific IgE antibodies."
Can you outgrow or desensitize yourself to celiac disease?,"No. Celiac disease does not go away. Once you have been diagnosed with celiac disease, you will need to follow a gluten-free diet for life. If you start eating gluten again, you will damage the lining of your intestines; it just may take a while for the symptoms to come back."
Do I need to follow a gluten-free diet if I have been diagnosed with celiac disease but have never had any symptoms?,"If you have asymptomatic celiac disease, it is recommended that you follow a gluten-free diet. You will still have damaged villi in your intestines and you may have malabsorption problems that are causing silent conditions such as osteoporosis. If you have doubts about the accuracy of your diagnosis, you may want to work with your health practitioner to verify the findings."
Can I have oats in my diet?,This is somewhat controversial. Some experts feel that oats should be avoided by those with celiac disease while others believe that most people can tolerate small amounts. They feel that the proteins found in oats are not contributing significantly to celiac disease. This is something you should discuss with your healthcare practitioner and a nutritionist.
How do I know what to eat and where can I get help?,"Your healthcare practitioner will have information for you on celiac disease. You can also visit the links listed at the end of this article under Related Content for several organizations that have resources, including support groups."
Are there other ways to test for celiac disease?,"Genetic tests that look for the markers that are strongly associated with celiac disease have recently become available. These tests look for the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) markers DQ2 and DQ8. A positive result does not diagnose celiac disease since about 30% of the general population also carry these markers but do not have the disease. However, almost all people with celiac disease are positive for DQ2 or DQ8, so a negative result can essentially rule out celiac disease in those individuals for whom results of other tests, including biopsy, are unclear. These tests are most useful for family members of individuals with the disease that fall into a high-risk category and for those with other diagnostic test results that are inconclusive."
What can be done about post-lumbar puncture pain?,"Headaches are relatively common after a lumbar puncture and can occur immediately or up to a day or two after the sample collection. Lying flat after the procedure can help avoid and treat the headaches. Other potential treatments include drinking water (to stay hydrated), caffeine, and pain medication. Follow your healthcare practitioner's recommendations and let them know if the pain persists."
Are there other reasons to do a lumbar puncture?,"Yes. Sometimes it will be performed to introduce anesthetics or medications into the central nervous system. Sometimes, one or more lumbar punctures and removal of CSF may be used to decrease CSF pressure."
Why do I need a spinal tap? Why can't my blood or urine be tested?,"CSF is often the best sample to use for diagnosing conditions affecting your central nervous system because this fluid surrounds your brain and spinal cord. Central nervous system infections or diseases are most easily and rapidly identified by CSF testing, as these conditions typically lead to changes in the makeup of the spinal fluid. Tests on blood and urine may be used in conjunction with CSF analysis to evaluate your condition, however the evaluation of these specimens alone cannot be relied on to establish the presence of disease in the central nervous system."
What other tests may be done in addition to CSF testing?,"Other laboratory tests that may be ordered along with or following CSF testing include:

Blood culture—to detect and identify bacteria or fungi in the blood
Culture and/or molecular testing of specimens collected from other possible sites of infection that led to meningitis or encephalitis
Blood glucose, total protein—to compare with CSF glucose and protein levels
CBC (complete blood count)—to evaluate cell counts in blood
Blood tests (serologic testing) to detect proteins released from disease-causing microbes (pathogens) or antibodies against a variety of pathogens, such as West Nile Virus and other arboviruses
CRP (C-reactive protein)—this is the preferred test to detect inflammation. An ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) may be done instead if CRP is not available.
CMP (comprehensive metabolic panel)—a group of tests used to evaluate electrolyte balance and the health of your organs"
Is shingles contagious?,"Yes, but not as contagious as chickenpox. The infected person's vesicles contain virus, but respiratory secretions usually do not."
Can you get shingles by being exposed to someone who has active symptoms of shingles?,"No, shingles is not passed from person to person. Shingles may develop only after you have had an initial case of chickenpox. If you have never had chickenpox or have not been vaccinated and someone who has shingles exposes you to the virus for the first time, you could get chickenpox but not shingles."
Does chickenpox leave scars? ,Not in most cases. Sometimes the itchy sores can become infected with bacteria when someone scratches. This may increase the likelihood of scarring.
Do chickenpox and shingles occur throughout the world?,"Yes, varicella zoster virus (VZV) infections are found throughout the world."
"If I get treated, can I get chlamydia again?","Yes. Even though treatment will cure your infection, you can get it again if you are exposed again. In fact, reinfection is common, according to the CDC."
Should I tell my partner that I have chlamydia?,"Yes, you should tell your sexual partner(s) that you have chlamydia so that they can get tested and treated."
Does having chlamydia put me at greater risk for other STDs?,"Yes, people who are infected have a higher risk of contracting other sexually transmitted diseases, including a 3 to 5 times greater risk of acquiring HIV if exposed to it."
My chloride level is only slightly out of range. What does this mean?,"Your chloride result is interpreted by your healthcare practitioner within the context of other tests that you have had done as well as other factors, such as your medical history. A single high or low result may or may not have medical significance. Generally, this is the case when the test value is only slightly higher or lower than the reference range. This is why healthcare practitioners may repeat a test on you and why they may look at results from prior times when you had the same test performed.
On the other hand, a result outside the range may indicate a problem and warrant further investigation. Your healthcare practitioner will evaluate your test results and determine whether a result that falls outside of the reference range means something significant for you."
Are there dietary recommendations for chloride?,"Yes. The Food and Nutrition Board at the Institute of Medicine recommends that healthy adults ages 19 to 50 years consume 2.3 grams of chloride or 3.8 grams of salt per day. The recommendations vary based on age, sex, and other factors. These amounts replace what is lost on average each day through sweat. (For additional details, see the Food and Nutrition Board’s Dietary Reference Intakes.) Chloride is readily available in the food supply and most Americans probably consume more than necessary, in the form of table salt and salt in prepared foods. It is also found in many vegetables and in foods such as salted meats, butter, tomatoes, lettuce, celery, and olives."
What treatment is prescribed for abnormal chloride levels?,"The same treatment used to treat sodium imbalances (diuretics, fluid replacement) may be used to treat chloride imbalances."
What causes high cholesterol?,"High cholesterol may be the result of an inherited disease or it may result from a diet high in saturated fats. For many people, it is caused by a combination of both a diet high in saturated and trans fats and an inherited tendency towards high cholesterol."
"I haven't changed my diet or exercise pattern, but my cholesterol has gone up since the last time it was tested. Why?",Cholesterol levels fluctuate over time. The measured cholesterol level may differ by as much as 10% from one month to another. It may go up sometimes or it may go down sometimes. These changes are called biological variation and they represent normal variability inherent in human metabolism.
"My doctor told me I had a high cholesterol test, but instead of treating me, he told me to wait a few months and test it again. Why?","Cholesterol levels fluctuate over time. A single measurement of cholesterol may not always reflect the ""usual” cholesterol level. For this reason, you may have at least two different measurements several weeks to several months apart before beginning any kind of treatment."
Can I be tested for cholinesterase in my healthcare provider's office?,"No, and not every laboratory will offer this testing. It may be necessary to send the sample collected to a reference laboratory."
"Besides a neuroendocrine tumor, what else can cause elevated CgA levels?","CgA levels may be elevated in conditions such as liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, chronic bronchitis, renal insufficiency, and stress. These possible causes for elevated CgA levels should be considered when interpreting test results.
Chromogranin A can also be increased in people who take proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or histamine 2 receptor antagonists, which are drugs that reduce the amount of stomach acid. Other medications that could alter the CgA level are serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which are used for the treatment of depression. It is sometimes recommended to avoid these medications to obtain reliable CgA results. Follow the instructions from your healthcare provider or laboratory and do not stop taking your medications unless instructed by your healthcare practitioner."
How does a healthcare practitioner locate the carcinoid or neuroendocrine tumor?,"This is usually accomplished through the use of imaging scans such as x-rays, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In some cases, surgery is required to find the tumor. For more on these imaging tests, visit RadiologyInfo.org."
How does the healthcare practitioner tell whether a tumor is benign or cancerous?,"In order to determine whether the tumor is benign or cancerous, the healthcare practitioner will need to perform a biopsy or remove the tumor surgically. The tumor is sent to the laboratory, where a pathologist examines the tumor cells using a microscope and makes a diagnosis. (For more on this, read the article on Anatomic Pathology.)"
Should everyone have this testing done?,"Chromosome analysis is frequently performed, but it is not indicated as a general screening test. The majority of people will never need to have one done."
Can a chromosome analysis be performed in my healthcare provider's office?,"No, it requires specialized equipment to perform and expertise to interpret. In most cases, samples will be sent to a reference laboratory."
Why does the karyotype take several days to perform?,"The cells that are tested must be cultured and cell division promoted. The amount of time that this takes will vary from sample to sample. Highly complex, abnormal karyotypes may require a longer time to evaluate."
What other laboratory tests might be done if I or my child has a negative cymotrypsin test?,Your healthcare provider may order a stool test for fecal fat or fecal elastase or a blood test for amylase or lipase to look at other aspects of pancreas and digestive function. Read the article on Pancreatic Insufficiency to learn more.
What causes pancreatic insufficiency?,"Pancreatic insufficiency can be caused by repeated bouts of acute pancreatitis or by chronic pancreatitis. It is less frequently but sometimes associated with pancreatic cancer. Other causes of insufficiency may include celiac disease, Crohn disease, autoimmune pancreatitis (immunoglobulin G4-related disease), Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and some surgical procedures that can lead to a decrease in gastrointestinal or pancreatic function.
Additionally, people who are carriers of a mutation in the CFTR gene may have pancreatic insufficiency and experience the associated signs and symptoms. (See the article on CFTR Gene Mutation Testing to learn more about carriers.)
In children, pancreatic insufficiency is most frequently associated with cystic fibrosis (CF) or Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome (SDS). SDS is the second most common cause of inherited pancreatic insufficiency, after CF. All those with SDS have some degree of pancreatic insufficiency beginning in infancy."
"If I have chest pain, does that mean I am having a heart attack? ","Many other problems can cause chest pain, and it is not always possible to tell just from the type of chest pain whether or not you are having a heart attack. Many people have chest pain from straining the muscles in their chest, and chest pain can occur with some lung problems. Chest pain can be a warning sign of hardening of the arteries of the heart (coronary artery disease or CAD). Chest pain that occurs during exercise, hard work, or at times of stress, lasts for a few minutes and goes away with rest is called angina. If the pain lasts longer than just a few minutes, especially if it occurs when you are resting, seek immediate medical attention."
What other tests detect a heart attack? ,"Healthcare practitioners may use more than one test to determine if a person who has chest pain is having a heart attack. Troponin is generally considered the most accurate test. Besides CK-MB, a CK test and a myoglobin test may be performed, although they are less specific as other conditions can also produce an increase in these two tests."
Is this test different than a platelet function test?,"Yes. This test is a genetic test that determines which form of the CYP2C19 gene you have, which may help predict how you will respond to clopidogrel."
Can platelet function assays be used to assess clopidogrel response?,"There are several platelet function assays that have been used for detecting nonresponse (termed ""clopidogrel resistance""), such as platelet aggregometry with ADP, with collagen epinephrine; however, their clinical utility has not been widely accepted due to poor agreement between the assays."
Should everyone be tested for CYP2C19 gene variations?,"Testing is not recommended to screen the general population. It is currently only indicated for those taking a drug that may be influenced by the activity of the CYP2C19-related enzymes. In some cases, a healthcare practitioner may recommend that family members of a poor metabolizer consider testing so that this information is on record."
Can clopidogrel resistance testing be done in my healthcare provider's office?,"No, it requires specialized equipment to perform and expertise to interpret. It is not offered by every laboratory and may need to be sent to a laboratory outside of your hospital (reference laboratory)."
Should I tell my other healthcare providers about my CYP2C19 test results?,"Yes, this would be good information for them to have, regardless of whether you are currently taking clopidogrel. CYP2C19 is also associated with response to many other drugs."
Should I tell my healthcare providers that I am taking clopidogrel?,"Yes, it is crucial for you to tell all of your healthcare providers and your dentist that you are taking clopidogrel, aspirin, or another antiplatelet agent. They will need to incorporate this information into any other treatments or procedures."
What else can cause diarrhea?,"Diarrhea can be caused by a number of infections and other conditions (see the full article on Diarrhea). It may be due to a pathogenic bacterial infection (commonly caused by Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter or  Escherichia coli), a viral infection, a parasitic infection, food intolerance, certain medications, chronic bowel disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or malabsorption disorders (such as celiac disease). Diarrhea may also be caused or worsened by psychological stresses."
Why must the stool sample be fresh?,"For Clostridium difficile toxin testing, the sample must be fresh because the toxin will break down in one to two hours and may result in a false-negative test."
Why shouldn't I take an over the counter anti-diarrhea medicine when I have diarrhea caused by C. difficile?,"Anti-diarrhea medication can slow down the passage of stool through the digestive tract, increasing the length of time that the colon is exposed to the toxin and increasing tissue damage and inflammation."
"Once I've had a C. difficile infection, can I be re-infected?","Yes, if symptoms reoccur shortly after the initial infection, it is generally a case of recurrence of overgrowth and toxin production by the same strain rather than an infection with a new strain. This happens because the normal bacterial flora has not re-colonized the digestive tract yet. A person who has had C. difficile diarrhea may also be at an increased risk of developing a new infection with future courses of antibiotics."
Are some antibiotics more likely to cause antibiotic-related diarrhea?,"Almost any antibiotic may lead to diarrhea since the drugs alter the normal population of good bacteria in the bowel. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, which kill many different types of bacteria, are more likely to wipe out normal bowel flora and allow C. difficile to overgrow and produce toxin."
Why are some inherited bleeding disorders more severe than others?,"The severity of bleeding depends on the individual, the degree of abnormality of the factor involved, as well as which factor is deficient. Those who have a severely deficient factor or one with significant factor dysfunction will have more severe manifestations of the disease. People with one normal gene copy and one altered gene copy (heterozygous) will tend to have less severe bleeding than those with two altered copies (homozygous).
It should be pointed out that people with a deficiency of factor XII are usually asymptomatic. This rare factor deficiency causes abnormal PTT results but is not associated with increased bleeding risk."
"If I have elevated cold agglutinins, is there anything I can do to make them go away or decrease them?  ",This is something that your healthcare practitioner will need to determine. Consult with your healthcare provider on what steps can be taken to decrease cold agglutinins.
What can I do to avoid the symptoms of cold agglutinin disease?,"To minimize episodes of painful discolored fingers and toes, and of abnormal red blood cell destruction (hemolysis), it is important to avoid and/or limit exposure to cold temperatures. People have differing sensitivities; some may be affected by drinking or eating something cold or by taking a cold shower. You should talk to your healthcare provider about strategies to manage your condition."
What are the other parts of the innate immune system?,"It includes:

The phagocytic system (white blood cells, including neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages), whose function is to ingest and digest invading microbes
Inflammatory mediators produced by various cells, including basophils, mast cells, and eosinophils
Natural killer (NK), B and T cells that are specialized lymphocytes that kill some tumors cells, microorganisms, and cells that have been infected by viruses 
Acute phase reactants and cytokines, which are a group of soluble proteins that can cause changes in the growth of many cells, including the white blood cells that produce them"
What diseases can a CBC detect?,"A CBC can help detect a number of conditions. Some examples include:

Anemia of various etiologies
Autoimmune disorders
Bone marrow disorders
Dehydration
Infections
Inflammation
Hemoglobin abnormalities
Leukemia
Low platelets
Lymphoma
Myeloproliferative neoplasms
Myelodysplastic syndrome
Sickle cell disease
Thalassemia
Nutritional deficiencies (e.g., Iron, B12 or folate)
Cancer that has spread to the bone marrow"
"If I have an abnormal result on my CBC, what other tests might my healthcare practitioner order as follow up?  ","It depends on the results that are abnormal and the suspected disease or condition as well as your medical history and findings from your physical examination. Your healthcare provider may request that a blood smear examination be done. Other general tests to check your health and to look for possible causes may include a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP). A few other general examples include:

Abnormal WBC results may be followed by tests for a suspected infection. Some examples include a culture of the affected area (e.g., blood culture, urine culture, sputum culture), a strep test or tests for viruses such as mononucleosis or EBV. If inflammation is suspected, then a CRP or ESR test may be done.
Abnormal RBC results may prompt a reticulocyte count, iron studies, tests for vitamin B12 and folate, G6PD, or hemoglobinopathy evaluation to help make a diagnosis.
An abnormal platelet count may be followed by tests that further evaluate platelets, such as HIT antibody. Additional tests may be done to check for bleeding disorders or excessive clotting disorders such as PT, PTT, von Willebrand factor or coagulation factors.

When a serious condition such as leukemia, lymphoma, myelodysplasia or another bone marrow disorder is suspected, then a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy may be necessary. Numerous other tests specific for certain conditions may be needed to establish a diagnosis, such as flow cytometry, chromosome analysis, and/or gene mutation analysis. Talk to your healthcare provider about the results of your CBC, whether additional tests are necessary, and why."
Are these tests always run as a panel?,"No. Each of these tests may be ordered individually. However, if your healthcare practitioner is interested in following two or more individual CMP components, your practitioner may order the entire CMP because it offers more information. Alternatively, a healthcare provider may order individual tests when monitoring specific conditions."
How is the CMP different than the BMP and why would my doctor order one over the other?,"The CMP typically includes 14 tests. The basic metabolic panel (BMP) is a subset of the CMP and usually includes 8 tests. It does not include the liver tests (ALP, ALT, AST, and bilirubin) and protein tests (albumin and total protein). Healthcare practitioners may order a CMP rather than a BMP if they want to get a more complete picture of the health of your organs or to check for specific conditions, such as diabetes, liver disease, or kidney disease."
One of the results from my CMP is slightly out of range. What does this mean?,"The results of your CMP are interpreted by your healthcare provider within the context of other tests that you have had done as well as other factors, such as your medical history. A single result that is slightly high or low may or may not have medical significance. There are several reasons why a test result may differ on different days and why it may fall outside a designated reference range.

Biological variability (different results in the same person at different times): If a healthcare practitioner runs the same test on you on several different occasions, there's a good chance that one result will fall outside a reference range even though you are in good health. For biological reasons, your values can vary from day to day.
Individual variability (differences in results between different people): References ranges are usually established by collecting results from a large population and determining from the data an expected average (mean) result and expected differences from that average (standard deviation). There are individuals who are healthy but whose tests results, which are normal for them, do not always fall within the expected range of the overall population.

Thus, a test value that falls outside of the established reference range supplied by the laboratory may mean nothing significant. Generally, this is the case when the test value is only slightly higher or lower than the reference range and this is why a healthcare practitioner may repeat a test on you and why the practitioner may look at results from prior times when you had the same test performed.
However, a result outside the range may indicate a problem and warrant further investigation. Your healthcare provider will evaluate your test results in the context of your medical history, physical examination, and other relevant factors to determine whether a result that falls outside of the reference range means something significant for you.
For more, read the articles on Reference Ranges and What They Mean and How Reliable is Laboratory Testing?"
Are all CGM devices the same?,"No, they vary by manufacturer. They all measure glucose in the interstitial space, but the number of days of use and the intended user ages can be different. Some CGMs may trigger an alarm, and the way that they send alerts and/or report can also vary. As they continue to improve, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology (AACE/ACE) and others in the medical community would like to see some standardization with the devices, potentially including:

Default alert levels, such as glucose less than 70 mg/dL for hypoglycemia and glucose greater than 300 mg/dL for hyperglycemia, as well as other triggers that can be programmed by the healthcare practitioner and/or the person wearing the CGM device
Standardized reporting (which would make it easier for people and for healthcare practitioners to evaluate them)
Displays with current glucose levels, trend arrows (i.e., is glucose going up or down), and graphs that show glucose patterns for the last day
Insulin pump data (where applicable) that can be downloaded and viewed along with glucose data"
Can I buy a CGM device over-the-counter?,"No, the CGM devices require a prescription."
Can I monitor my child’s type 1 diabetes with a CGM device?,"Yes, there are CGM devices that can display the results to the person being tested and also send the results to several other peoples' smart phones (such as the parent and healthcare practitioner), send alert text messages, and display graphed data over time."
Can I use a device for longer than indicated?,"No, they are approved for specific periods of use and need to be replaced as indicated by the manufacturer. It is likely that CGM devices will be able to be worn longer in the future as they continue to improve."
Can I choose either a blood (total or free) or urine copper test?,These tests provide complementary information and your healthcare practitioner will determine which tests are necessary to evaluate your condition.
Should I be taking copper supplements or trying to get more copper in my diet?,"In most cases, a regular diet satisfies the body's requirements for copper. Talk to your healthcare practitioner before taking any supplements or changing your diet."
Do I need to have a liver biopsy?,"If Wilson disease is strongly suspected based upon blood, urine, and imaging test results, a liver biopsy may be performed to evaluate how much copper is in your liver and the extent of liver damage."
Should I self-quarantine if I am exposed to someone with COVID-19 or if I have respiratory symptoms?,"Even if you don't show symptoms or do not get tested, health experts recommend quarantining yourself for 10-14 days if you have been exposed to coronavirus by being in close contact with someone who has been confirmed or suspected to have the disease. You may not know if you have been exposed, but if you start to show respiratory signs or symptoms, you should self-quarantine for 14 days."
"If I am infected but don’t have symptoms, can I still spread the virus?","Yes. Some people who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 don't display any symptoms—they're asymptomatic. However, they can still be contagious and spread the virus to other people (carriers), which is why quarantining is important after you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, even if you have no symptoms."
Can I test myself for COVID-19 at home?,"Yes. The FDA recently issued emergency use authorizations for some COVID-19 tests that can be used for testing yourself at home. Some of these at-home tests detect viral proteins (antigens) in the sample and a few detect the RNA of the virus. They generally provide results within 15 to 30 minutes. While some require a prescription from a doctor, at least one is available without a prescription. To use the antigen tests, the user must first download the appropriate application (app) for a smart phone.
In addition, there are several commercial laboratories that can send collection kits to patients so they can use them to collect a nasal sample at home, and then send the sample back to the lab for a very specific molecular test.
Although home tests can offer many benefits like rapid results, it's also important to recognize the potential tradeoffs between quality and convenience. Errors can arise with any type of home test because of a number of possible mistakes. These range from improper storage to errors in how you collect your sample and perform the test. For more information and tips on home testing, read With Home Testing, Consumers Take Charge of Their Health."
How accurate is the COVID-19 RT-PCR test?,"While lab professionals and test developers work to ensure that tests are accurate as possible, no test is 100% perfect. The COVID-19 RT-PCR tests are very specific for the virus, but there is a small chance to get a false-positive (testing positive without being infected with the virus). Additionally, a negative RT-PCR test means you were probably not infected at the time the sample was collected, but there is a possibility that there was a problem with sample collection, storage or transport or that not enough virus was present in the sample to be detected. This could lead to a false negative (testing negative despite being infected with the virus). For more in-depth information, see the article How Reliable is Laboratory Testing?"
Should I get a RT-PCR or antigen test a second time or multiple times?,"If you have a negative RT-PCR or antigen test and still show symptoms, you may need to be tested a second time. Your healthcare practitioner will decide if it is necessary for you to be retested. Your healthcare practitioner and/or employer may require additional tests depending on the circumstances."
How long does it take to get RT-PCR test results?,"The amount of time it takes to get COVID-19 test results varies based on where you get tested. Once swabbed, the specimen gets sent to a lab. Sometimes, the lab is onsite, but often, it must be sent to an outside laboratory for processing. There may be a backlog of tests, increasing the amount of time it takes to get results. Therefore, you may get your tests results as quickly as within 24 hours, or it may take between five and 10 days."
What happens if I test positive for the virus?,"If you test positive, you need to take several steps to keep the SARS-CoV-2 virus from spreading to others in your home and community:

Stay home, unless it's to get medical care. Ask others to take care of needs such as grocery shopping.
Stay in touch with your doctor and monitor your symptoms. If your symptoms get worse, call your doctor.
If you have trouble breathing or other severe symptoms, seek medical care immediately.
Stay away from others in your home and use a separate bathroom if possible.
Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or with your elbow. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, and often.
Areas and surfaces in your home should be cleaned and disinfected often. The areas where you are isolated should be cleaned every day. (See the CDC's resource on Cleaning and Disinfection for Households.)
If you will be visiting your doctor, call ahead first so they can protect others who may not have the virus by giving you a mask and your own area to wait.

More details can be found at the CDC's COVID-19 resource, Caring for Yourself at Home."
"If I have a positive RT-PCR or antigen test, should my family or household members be tested? ","If you have a confirmed case of COVID-19, all your close contacts (within 6 feet of you for at least 15 minutes) should be tested. If this includes your family or household members, then they should be tested."
Do I need both tests (blood and urine) or is one better than the other?,"If your healthcare provider suspects Cushing syndrome, usually both blood and urine are tested as they offer complementary information. Blood cortisol is easier to collect but is affected more by stress than is the 24-hour urine test. Salivary cortisol may sometimes be tested instead of blood cortisol."
How do I tell if a high cortisol level isn't just from stress? ,There are several approaches that your healthcare provider can take. The simplest involves repeating tests at a time when you feel less stressed. Your healthcare provider can also give you varying doses of a medicine that replaces cortisol (usually dexamethasone) to see if this decreases your cortisol level. Multiple tests are often needed to tell if stress or disease is causing a high cortisol level.
Should everyone with muscle pain and weakness have a CK test?,"Muscle pain and weakness are common symptoms that are seen with many temporary conditions. General, routine CK testing is usually not required. However, if someone is taking a drug or has been exposed to a substance that has been linked with potential muscle damage and presents with muscle weakness, muscle aches, and/or dark urine, then CK testing may be indicated."
Is there anything I can do to lower my CK level?,"CK levels are a reflection of muscle damage. Temporary increases are seen with strenuous exercise but are not typically a concern unless severe or combined with extreme heat or humidity. An Increase in CK that is due to exposure to a toxin or a drug can be resolved by avoiding the toxin and/or potentially stopping taking the drug or changing therapy. You should not, however, stop taking a medication without first consulting with your healthcare provider. Increases in CK that are due to an underlying disease, such as uncontrolled diabetes or hypothyroidism, may resolve by controlling the condition."
Is the CK test used for purposes other than detecting skeletal muscle damage?,"The CK test was once one of the primary tests ordered to help diagnose a heart attack, but in the U.S., this use of CK has been largely replaced by the troponin test. However, the CK test may sometimes be used to help detect a second heart attack that occurs shortly after the first. A series of CK tests may be used to monitor heart damage to see if it resolves or continues.
The heart damage that occurs during a heart attack can cause increased CK levels within a few hours. Levels peak within 12 to 24 hours and then return to normal within 2 to 4 days. If additional damage occurs or it is ongoing, such as during a second or subsequent heart attack, then CK levels may stay elevated.
Sometimes, the CK test may be ordered when a heart attack is suspected and a troponin test is not available. In this case, when CK is elevated, a CK-MB test may be used as a follow-up test to determine whether the increase is due to heart damage or skeletal muscle damage.
Chest pain and increased CK levels plus elevated CK-MB indicate that it is likely that a person has recently had a heart attack. Levels that drop, then rise again may indicate a second heart attack and/or ongoing heart damage."
My creatinine result is slightly out of range. What does this mean?,"Your creatinine result is interpreted by your healthcare provider within the context of other tests that you have had done as well as other factors, such as your medical history. A single result that is slightly high or low may or may not have medical significance. This is why a healthcare practitioner may repeat a test on you and why they may look at results from prior times when you had the same test performed.
However, a result outside the range may indicate a problem and warrant further investigation. Your healthcare provider will evaluate your test results in the context of other relevant factors to determine whether a result that falls outside of the reference range means something significant for you.
For more, read the article Reference Ranges and What They Mean."
Will exercise affect my creatinine levels?,"In general, moderate exercise will not affect your creatinine levels. As you continue to exercise and build muscle mass, your creatinine levels may increase slightly but not to abnormal levels."
How does diet affect creatinine levels?,Some studies have shown that eating cooked meat prior to testing can temporarily increase the level of creatinine. Creatinine levels may be 10%-30% higher in people who eat a diet that is very high in meat.
What can I do to make my creatinine level normal?,"Creatinine is a reflection of processes that are going on in your body and of kidney function. It is not generally responsive to lifestyle changes. If you have an elevated creatinine that is due to a temporary condition, such as a kidney infection, then it should return to normal as the infection resolves. If it is elevated due to an underlying chronic condition that can affect kidney function, such as diabetes, then it will reflect changes in kidney function and is likely to stabilize if or when the condition is under control."
Do creatinine levels change with age?,"Creatinine levels relate to both muscle mass and to kidney function. As you age, your muscle mass decreases but your kidneys tend to function less effectively. The net result is not much change in creatinine levels in the blood as you get older."
Why would a urine creatinine be ordered along with a urine drug test?,"When people are having drugs-of-abuse testing performed, they may try to ""trick the system"" by diluting their urine with water (directly or by drinking lots of water) or by adding another adulterating substance to the urine. Since creatinine is produced and released into the urine at a constant rate, it should be present in a normal concentration. The test can be ordered, along with other tests such as a pH and specific gravity and/or tests for adulterants, to help evaluate the validity of a urine sample. If the creatinine is lower than typically seen in a human urine, then it is more likely that the sample has been tampered with or that the person has had too much water to drink. In both of these cases, the urine sample will not be considered suitable for testing and will need to be recollected."
Why do I have to collect my urine for 24 hours?,"A 24-hour urine sample is required instead of a random urine sample because the amount of creatinine in the urine will vary somewhat during the course of a day. By collecting all urine for 24 hours, the amount of creatinine in the urine can be averaged over the entire day and will give a better indication of what is going on in the body."
What should I do if I forget to save one urine sample during the collection?,"If you do not have a complete collection, the results will not be valid. You should call your healthcare practitioner's office or the laboratory where you obtained your collection container to ask if you should discontinue the test and begin again another day."
Are there other ways to estimate or determine the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of my kidneys?,"Yes. The GFR can be estimated with a simple blood creatinine test (see the article on eGFR). Given a measurement of the amount of creatinine in a blood sample, the healthcare practitioner will use a formula to estimate the rate at which the kidneys are filtering blood. The formulas take relevant factors into account, such as the person's age, weight, height, and ethnicity.
The collection of a 24-hour urine specimen needed for the creatinine clearance test can be impractical to obtain, so the eGFR calculations are usually the preferred method for evaluating kidney function. The creatinine clearance test specifically may be ordered when a healthcare practitioner suspects a problem with blood flow to the kidneys."
Is there something I can do to get rid of my cryoglobulins?,"In general, no. If they are due to a temporary condition, such as a bacterial infection, then they may go away when the infection resolves. If they are due to a chronic condition, such as an autoimmune disorder, then they are likely to persist. In some cases, apheresis may be performed to remove cryoglobulins from the blood and to relieve symptoms, but this may help only temporarily."
What are some other tests that may be done to determine the underlying cause of cryoglobulinemia?,"In addition to protein electrophoresis and, depending on the suspected underlying condition, other tests that may be performed include hepatitis C, ANA, mono test and rheumatoid factor, to name a few."
Should everyone be tested for CCP antibody?,"No. CCP antibody is not recommended as a screening test. Like RF, it is best used to evaluate individuals whose clinical signs suggest RA or who have already been diagnosed with undifferentiated arthritis."
Can I be tested for CCP antibody in my doctor's office?,Anti-CCP testing is widely available and may be tested for by your physician. This test may not be available in all laboratories but can be routinely sent to a reference laboratory.
Will my CCP antibody ever go away?,"Like other autoantibodies, once developed by the body's immune system, levels of CCP antibodies may fluctuate over time but will not go away. CCP antibody levels may decrease with treatment."
What other tests might my doctor order in evaluating me for RA?,"Your healthcare provider may choose to order an ESR and/or CRP, tests that detect inflammation. The healthcare practitioner may also order a complete blood count (CBC) to check for a high white blood cell count, another sign of inflammation, and to check for anemia, a condition common in people with RA. For added information, an analysis of joint fluid (synovial fluid) may be performed. In addition, your healthcare provider may also order antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing. A negative ANA helps exclude lupus and other systemic rheumatic diseases; the ANA may be positive in up to one-third of patients with RA."
Will this CF gene mutation panel detect any other genetic diseases?,"No, it is only checking for specific CF mutations. Currently, every genetic disease requires specific DNA testing to identify it (assuming that the gene and mutations causing it are known)."
Does this test detect all genetic causes of cystic fibrosis?,"No. To date, more than 2,000 different mutations of the CFTR gene that cause cystic fibrosis have been identified, but only a few of the mutations are common. Some laboratories use the standard panel recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that tests for 23 of the most common mutations (those with frequencies greater than 0.1% in the general U.S. population). Some laboratories offer expanded panels of up to 100 or more mutations. However, even these will not detect all genetic causes of cystic fibrosis."
Does my risk of being a carrier vary depending on my ethnic background?,"Yes. Generally, the frequency of CF carriers is highest in Caucasians and Ashkenazi Jewish populations and is lower in other ethnic groups. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the risk of being a carrier before genetic testing for different ethnic groups are estimated as follows:

Caucasians: 1 in 25
Ashkenazi Jewish: 1 in 24
Hispanic white: 1 in 58
African American: 1 in 61
Asian American: 1 in 94

Since the ancestry of the U.S. population is becoming increasingly blended, the historical data and statistical risks are changing. Quoted risks based on ancestry are estimates, and the risk for individuals of mixed ancestry may be unknown. Some families may also carry the additional risk of specific rare mutations within their family tree."
Do all states require or offer newborn screening for CF? Do I need to request it?,"Every state's newborn screening program includes a test for cystic fibrosis, so you will not need to request it. The method used may vary, with some states performing a blood test to determine the level of immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) and others screening for CF with gene mutation testing."
How can I tell if my cytomegalovirus (CMV) has reactivated?,"If you are a reasonably healthy person, you will probably not have a symptomatic reactivation or may have mild flu-like symptoms. If you are immune-compromised, you may have more serious symptoms associated with your lungs, digestive tract, or eyes. In this case, it is important to talk to your healthcare provider about your health concerns."
"If I have or had CMV, can I spread it to others?","If you have a new or prior infection with CMV, you can spread it to others even if you aren't showing signs or symptoms. If symptoms appear, they can develop 9 to 60 days after primary infection. Nevertheless, you must be in close contact with others in order to transmit the virus. It can be spread through several types of body fluids, including saliva, breast milk, vaginal fluids, semen, urine, and blood."
What are some common risk factors for inappropriate blood clotting?,"Some risk factors include:

Major surgery or trauma
Hospitalization or living in a nursing home
Prolonged immobility—this can include long trips by plane, car, etc. or prolonged bed rest
Use of birth control or hormone replacement therapy
Broken bone, cast
Pregnancy or recent childbirth
Antiphospholipid syndrome
Certain cancers
Inherited clotting disorder such as factor V Leiden mutation
History of prior venous thromboembolism (VTE)
Obesity
Smoking"
What other procedures might my healthcare practitioner order if my D-dimer is positive?,"In an emergency room setting, if you are found to be at low to intermediate risk for thrombosis and/or venous thromboembolism and when you have a positive D-dimer test, your healthcare practitioner will likely order a non-invasive scanning procedure, such as a venous ultrasound, multi-detector helical computed axial tomography (CT), direct pulmonary angiography, or ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan. For more on these, see RadiologyInfo.org: Blood Clots."
Can dengue fever be passed from person to person?,"No, the virus is not spread by person-to-person contact or by exposure to respiratory secretions. The virus is spread when a mosquito bites an infected person, then bites a healthy person. It may be transmitted in rare cases through a blood transfusion, organ donation, or mother to fetus."
"If I have had dengue fever, can I get it again? ","Yes. There are four types (serotypes) of the dengue virus. You may be infected with one serotype and then infected later with a different serotype. There is no cross-protective immunity to all dengue viruses when you are exposed to one serotype. In addition, a subsequent infection with a dengue fever virus is usually associated with more severe disease."
"If I have liver cancer in my family, should I be tested for DCP?",DCP is not intended to be used to screen the general population or those who are healthy. A DCP test may be occasionally performed if you have chronic liver disease and your healthcare practitioner wants the additional information it may offer.
"If I have hepatitis, should I have a DCP test performed?","You should talk to your healthcare practitioner. Guidelines by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) do not recommend using DCP as a screening test for the development of HCC, but it is used for this purpose in some other parts of the world."
Does my sample for a DHEAS level have to be drawn at a certain time of day like other hormone tests?,"Some hormones are increased in the morning while others rise and fall throughout the day. Some are released intermittently or with increased activity or in response to stress. Some hormones are higher at particular times of the month, and others are relatively stable. Blood sample collection for some hormone tests are timed so that the hormones can be evaluated at their highest or lowest levels. The DHEAS concentration, however, is stable, so your sample may be collected any time of day and it will not affect the result of the test."
Does everyone with elevated DHEAS have symptoms?,"Not necessarily. It may be difficult to determine when adult men have an elevated level of DHEAS (since they already have masculine secondary sexual characteristics) and women of some ethnic groups (for example, Asian women) may have elevated levels of testosterone and DHEAS without exhibiting symptoms such as excess hair growth or acne. Also, it should be noted that symptoms and their severity will vary from person to person."
Can the DHEAS test be performed in my healthcare practitioner's office?,"No, the testing requires specialized equipment and is not performed in every laboratory. Your blood may need to be sent to a reference laboratory for testing."
How long will I need to be on digoxin?,"Digoxin is prescribed to treat heart failure, a long-term, chronic condition. It will not cure heart failure but will help to control it. You may have to take digoxin — and have tests to monitor its level in the blood — for the rest of your life."
Who orders digoxin tests?,"Your primary care provider may order the test, but a cardiologist may also monitor levels of digoxin in your blood."
Why is it important to have my blood drawn for my digoxin test at a certain time?,"Timing of the digoxin blood test is important because if the sample is drawn too soon after a dose, the results of the test may be erroneously high and will show a toxic level when that is not the case. Typically, a blood sample should be drawn 6-8 hours after a dose. Many times, the blood sample will be drawn just before the next dose is to be taken."
Can I get antibodies from donating blood?,"No, you will not be exposed to anyone else's blood while donating."
"If a mother has an incompatibility with one child, will she have them with all of her children? ","It depends on whether the baby has the corresponding antigens for the mother's antibodies. A baby born to a blood group O mother may have hemolytic disease of the newborn in any pregnancy. When a mother is Rh-negative, she may develop antibodies against the red blood cells of her first Rh-positive child if she does not receive prophylaxis. Any subsequent Rh-positive children may then be affected by the mother's Rh antibodies. Fortunately, this is now relatively rare as Rh-negative mothers are tested during and after their pregnancy and are given RhIg (RhImmune Globulin, Rhogam) injections to prevent the development of Rh antibodies. Other antibodies may also recur in subsequent pregnancies and need to be discussed with the mother's healthcare provider."
Why doesn't a drug screen measure all drugs?,"Drug tests are set up for their specific uses, typically workplace and legal testing. Some laboratories may offer more than one drug screen panel or a health practitioner, or other authorized entity, may select tests individually."
Why might a healthcare provider only test for a single drug?,"If a health practitioner strongly suspects that a person has taken a specific drug or is monitoring the person for previous abuse of that substance, then the practitioner may order only that drug test. Another reason for ordering a single test is if the suspect drug is not part of an offered drug screen."
Why would someone be tested for something that is legal?,"A substance can be legal but may be banned in certain circumstances. For instance, an insurance company may test an insurance applicant for nicotine to verify the person's assertion that he or she is not currently using tobacco. In the case of prescription medications, the high addictive potential for certain medications makes drug testing important. In the case of some athletes, many of the prohibited substances are legal but have the potential to affect the athlete's performance. Athletes must exercise caution in their choices of medications as they are ultimately responsible for any substances detected in their bodies."
What other testing might be done?,"ALK and/or ROS1 mutation testing are recommended to determine whether a person's tumor would be likely to respond to specific targeted therapies that are effective when an ALK or ROS1 mutation is detected. Testing for mutations in other genes (e.g., KRAS) may be offered for lung cancer patients if there is enough tissue sample available."
How long does it take for EGFR testing results?,"EGFR mutation testing is not available in every laboratory. If a healthcare practitioner sends a sample to a reference laboratory and depending on the test method used, the results may take a few days to several days before they are available."
Can I have my blood tested instead of having a tissue biopsy?,"For diagnosis of your tumor, you will need a conventional tissue biopsy. In addition, blood tests for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), also called liquid biopsies, may be done to detect EGFR mutations in the tumor that can predict potential responsiveness or resistance to targeted therapies.

CtDNA testing may be used to detect mutations that make the tumor sensitive to targeted therapy (sensitizing mutations). However, ctDNA testing is known to sometimes give false-negative results (meaning the mutation is present but not detected by the ctDNA testing). For this reason, the FDA recommends a tissue biopsy if the liquid biopsy is negative (doesn't detect a sensitizing mutation).
In addition, a liquid biopsy may be used to detect an EGFR T790M mutation, which causes resistance to targeted therapy. However, data are currently limited on this, so a liquid biopsy may be used only if a tissue biopsy cannot be obtained.

Also, patients may wish to consult their health insurance company as to whether this blood testing would be covered."
What is the difference between EGFR (also known as HER-1) and HER-2?,"EGFR and HER-2 are both members of the same family of cell membrane receptors. When either EGFR or HER-2 is significantly increased in a cancer, it often indicates a more aggressive tumor and a poorer patient prognosis. The primary differences between EGFR and HER-2 testing are that they are ordered to help evaluate different types of cancer and that the drugs that have been developed to target them are specific for that particular receptor, EGFR or HER-2. HER-2 is evaluated in breast cancer and cancer of the stomach and esophagus (gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma)."
Are there other types of testing that evaluate EGFR in tumors?,"There are tests available that identify other changes in EGFR known as gene amplification, which means an abnormally increased number of copies of the EGFR gene are present in the tumor cells. Another type of test looks at the amount of EGFR protein present on the tumor cells. These tests are not helpful for identifying patients with lung cancer who may benefit from EGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. However, they may have a role in other types of cancer. For example, sometimes tests for EGFR gene amplification are used to determine the likely course (prognosis) of cancer of the head and neck."
"Besides lung cancer, are there other types of cancers that have increased EGFR protein?","Other types of cancer that may have increased EGFR protein present include colon cancer, glioblastoma (a type of brain cancer), and cancers of the head and neck, breast, and pancreas. EGFR blocking agents are routinely used for treatment of metastatic colon cancer and are used with some head and neck cancers. The utility of EGFR inhibitors and their correlation with EGFR mutations in different types of cancers hasn't been fully established but continues to be investigated."
One of the results from my electrolyte panel is slightly out of range. What does this mean?,"The results of your electrolyte panel are interpreted by your healthcare practitioner within the context of other tests that you have had done as well as other factors, such as your medical history. A single result that is slightly high or low may or may not have medical significance. There are several reasons why a test result may differ on different days and why it may fall outside a designated reference range.

Biological variability (different results in the same person at different times): If a healthcare practitioner runs the same test on you on several different occasions, there is a good chance that one result will fall outside a reference range even though you are in good health. For biological reasons, your values can vary from day to day.
Individual variability (differences in results between different people): References ranges are usually established by collecting results from a large population and determining from the data an expected average (mean) result and expected differences from that average (standard deviation). There are individuals who are healthy but whose tests results, which are normal for them, do not always fall within the expected range of the overall population.

So, a test value that falls outside of the established reference range may mean nothing significant. Generally, this is the case when the test value is only slightly higher or lower than the reference range and is why a healthcare practitioner may repeat a test on you and why the practitioner may look at results from prior times when you had the same test performed.
However, a result outside the range may indicate a problem and warrant further investigation. Your healthcare practitioner will evaluate your test results in the context of your medical history, physical exam, and other relevant factors to determine whether a result that falls outside of the reference range means something significant for you. For more, read the article on Reference Ranges and What They Mean."
Why would an ER doctor want to know about all other medications and supplements that a person has taken when it is known that the person has taken a large quantity of a specific drug? ,It is important for the health practitioner to consider what drug interactions might be contributing to a person's symptoms.
How would an ER physician evaluate an unconscious person or a child who is unable to tell what he or she has taken?,"The health practitioner would select tests based upon the person's clinical findings. The healthcare provider would consider an overdose but also other medical conditions. If the results of initial testing (such as tier one tests) do not show the cause of the person's symptoms and that person's status is unchanged, then additional tests may be ordered to further investigate the cause."
Why might an ER doctor test a person for acetaminophen if he or she denies taking it?,"The person might not realize that one or more of the medications that he or she is taking has acetaminophen in it and the person may not initially have symptoms. However, it is important to detect the presence of an overdose of acetaminophen so that the proper treatment can be given as soon as possible after ingestion."
Do adults get mono?,"They do, but it is rare because most have already been infected with EBV at an earlier age. When they do, they tend to have less lymph node swelling and sore throat and more liver enlargement and jaundice."
Do EBV infection and mono occur throughout the world?,"Yes. In emerging nations, however, mono is not as common because most of the population is infected with EBV earlier in life when symptoms are minimal."
"If I have had EBV infection, can I still get mono?","No. Once you have had an EBV infection, you will not get mono. You could, however, experience similar symptoms from another viral illness. In individuals with weakened immune systems, the virus can reactivate and cause illness."
"Why is mono sometimes called ""the kissing disease""?","This is because EBV is present in the saliva of an infected individual and is commonly spread through kissing. It can also be spread, especially in the case of children, through saliva transfer to hands and/or toys and by sharing utensils or cups."
Are there other types of tests available for EBV?,Yes. There are molecular tests that can detect and measure EBV DNA.
How long will it take for my ESR result?,"That depends on the laboratory performing the test. Results may be available the same day or, if the sample is sent to a reference laboratory, it may take a day or two for your results.
Traditional ESR tests are read by a technician one hour after the test is started. Newer methods can be read at 20-30 minutes; and there are now commercial rapid tests available that use a centrifugal method and can be read five minutes after setup. This new method is being used more widely to shorten waiting times for patients, particularly in emergency departments."
What causes inflammation?,"Inflammation can occur over the short term (acute) or over a long period of time (chronic) and can be caused by a variety of conditions and disease. Some examples include:

Infections
Arthritis
Autoimmune diseases, such as lupus
Inflammatory bowel disease

 "
What other tests might my doctor order besides ESR?,"Your health practitioner may order the C-reactive protein (CRP) test as well as other general tests, such as a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) or a complete blood count (CBC), at the same time as the ESR. ESR and C-reactive protein (CRP) are both markers of inflammation. Generally, ESR does not change as rapidly as does CRP, either at the start of inflammation or as it resolves. CRP is not affected by as many other factors as is ESR, making it a better marker of inflammation. However, because ESR is an easily performed test, many healthcare practitioners still use ESR as an initial test when they think a patient has inflammation.
Examples of other tests that may be ordered based on your symptoms include antinuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), fibrinogen or serum protein electrophoresis. An elevated ESR is typically a result of two types of proteins, globulins or fibrinogen. Depending on your medical history, signs, symptoms and what your health practitioner suspects is the cause, he or she may order a fibrinogen level (a clotting protein that is another marker of inflammation) and a serum protein electrophoresis to determine which of these (or both) is causing the elevated ESR. If severe infection is suspected, a blood culture may be done."
What do changes in my ESR mean?,"Changes in the ESR may indicate the presence or abatement of infection or inflammation. If you have a chronic inflammatory disease, the ESR may fluctuate with the degree of severity or clinical course of your condition."
Is there a treatment for low EPO?,"A synthetic form of erythropoietin (recombinant human erythropoietin or rh-EPO) may be used as a treatment to help increase RBC production in people with chronic kidney disease and other anemias related to bone marrow suppression and/or failure, such as that due to radiation or chemotherapy treatment for cancer. The drug treatment, which is given through a vein (intravenously) or under the skin (subcutaneous injection), is expensive and its stimulation of the bone marrow lasts only a few hours. The synthetic hormone's use has been promising, helping to decrease the need for blood transfusions and improving the quality life for many affected people.
In June 2011, The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that healthcare professionals adjust the ESAs for more conservative dosing in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) to improve the safety of these drugs. The data indicated increased risks of cardiovascular events (e.g., heart attacks and strokes) with ESAs in this patient population.
If you produce an abnormal form of hemoglobin, such as may occur with thalassemia, or if you have a bone marrow disorder, then erythropoietin replacement therapy will not help resolve the anemia."
Can adequate erythropoietin production by my kidneys be restored?,"Not directly. If your low EPO is due to a temporary kidney condition, then it may resolve as the kidney condition resolves. In many cases, however, low EPO is due to chronic kidney disease and will not get better over time. Your healthcare practitioner will work with you to address and minimize the effects of the resulting anemia and may treat you with synthetic erythropoietin (i.e., erythropoietin replacement therapy)."
Why isn't erythropoietin measured to monitor erythropoietin drug therapy?,"It is not used because it is the effect on the bone marrow – reflected by increased RBC and reticulocyte production and increasing hemoglobin – that is important in the resolution of anemia, not the concentration of erythropoietin in the blood. The amount needed will vary from person to person depending on their condition and the responsiveness of their bone marrow."
I’ve heard some athletes are tested for EPO. Why?,"Synthetic erythropoietin is also being used by some athletes as a form of ""blood doping."" Those who use it are trying to increase their endurance and oxygen capacity by increasing the number of RBCs in their blood. This use of the drug can be dangerous, resulting in hypertension and increasing the viscosity of the blood. Its use has been prohibited by most sports organizations, including the International Association of Athletics Federations, and erythropoietin is now being tested for as part of the Olympics anti-doping program. Read Drug Abuse Testing to learn more."
What other tests may be done to evaluate kidney function?,"Other tests that may be done to help detect kidney damage and/or evaluate kidney function are:

Urine albumin (microalbumin) and albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR)—used to screen people with chronic conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, that put them at an increased risk of developing kidney disease; increased levels of albumin in the urine may indicate kidney damage.
Urinalysis—may be used to help detect signs of kidney damage, such as the presence of blood or casts in the urine
Renal panel—a group of tests that may be used to evaluate kidney function and/or screen for, diagnose or monitor kidney disease

The creatinine clearance test also provides an estimate of kidney function and of the actual GFR. However, in addition to the serum creatinine, this test requires a timed urine collection (24 hours) for urine creatinine measurement in order to compare blood and urine creatinine concentrations and to calculate the clearance."
How can my actual GFR be determined?,"The best method for directly determining the GFR is a procedure called an ""inulin clearance."" It involves introducing a fluid containing the marker molecule inulin (NOT insulin) into your veins (IV – intravenous infusion) and then collecting timed urines over a period of hours. The urine volumes are noted and the inulin in each sample is measured to allow determination of the GFR. This test and other methods of determining GFR, such as those that use radioactive markers, are not routinely ordered and are primarily performed in research settings."
Could I calculate my own eGFR?,"If you have had a recent creatinine or cystatin C measurement, you can calculate the eGFR by using one of the calculators for people 19 years of age or older on the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) website. If you have questions about the interpretation of your results, it is best to consult with your healthcare provider. For children and teens younger than 19, see the pediatric eGFR calculator on the NKF website.

Is an eGFR always calculated when a creatinine test is ordered?,This practice is recommended and has been adopted by most laboratories. The eGFR can always be calculated at your healthcare provider's request.
Why might my healthcare provider repeat my eGFR test?,"Besides for periodic monitoring, the eGFR might be repeated if your healthcare provider feels that a temporary condition may be affecting your results."
What other findings might suggest kidney dysfunction?,Diabetics and others at risk for developing kidney disease may be monitored for small amounts of albumin in their urine by performing a urine albumin test. The presence of albumin and other plasma proteins as well as blood in the urine can all be signs of potential kidney damage.
"Why are factors such as age, sex, and race used in eGFR calculations?","This is because these factors are known to affect the level of creatinine in the blood. Creatinine is a waste product produced by muscles from the breakdown of a compound called creatine. According to the National Kidney Foundation, men tend to have more muscle mass than women so their creatinine levels tend to be higher. African Americans have a higher average muscle mass and generate more creatinine. As we age, we lose muscle mass and thus have lower blood creatinine levels for the same kidney function the older we get."
What other testing might be done?,"HER2 testing is typically done at the same time as hormone receptor status testing. Additional treatment options are possible for tumors that are HER2-positive and these cancers may benefit from anti-HER2 therapy regardless of hormone receptor status. Also, a healthcare practitioner may decide on a case-by-case basis whether to offer breast cancer gene expression profiling and, based on the results (as well as other factors), whether to offer additional treatment."
I was diagnosed with ductal-carcinoma in situ. Will hormone receptor testing be done?,"When you have been diagnosed with ductal-carcinoma in situ (DCIS, cancer confined to the breast ducts), you and your physician may choose to determine estrogen receptor status depending upon your treatment preferences. The 2017 NCCN guideline for breast cancer recommends ER testing DCIS. Results of ER testing of DCIS can help determine whether there may be an opportunity for adjuvant hormone therapy and reducing risk for recurrence or progression to invasive breast cancer."
Can a blood sample be used instead of a tissue sample to perform these tests?,"At present, there isn't a blood test that can substitute for testing tumor tissue obtained from a biopsy or surgically."
Would this testing also be performed on a man?,"Yes. Men do not get breast cancer as frequently as women, but it does occur and their cancer may also be ER- or PR-positive."
Do all men have estrogens?,"Yes. Although they are present in amounts far less than in women, they are present and are needed for hormonal balance and the function of other glands."
What are estrogen receptors?,Estrogen receptors are proteins in cells from certain tissues that bind with estrogen. This binding allows estrogen to act on these tissues. Tumors can also have estrogen receptors. Estrogen can stimulate the growth of estrogen receptor-positive tumors in women who have breast cancer. Drugs that block the effect of estrogen may slow the rate of growth of such cancers. See the article on Estrogen/Progesterone Receptor Status for more on this.
What are phytoestrogens and environmental estrogens?,"Phytoestrogens are estrogen-like compounds from plant sources. The two main classes are isoflavones, found in soy products, and lignans, found in whole grains and some fruits and vegetables. It has been proposed that these products could be used as an alternative to hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Initial studies have shown the relief of some menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes, but there is more research yet to be done.

Environmental estrogens are chemicals, either natural (such as plant sources) or man-made (such as the insecticide DDT), that mimic the effect of estrogen and may cause disorders such as infertility, overgrowth of the endometrial lining, premature breast development, and feminization in young males. They tend to stay in the body for long periods of time and are being studied for their long-term effects."
Can medical providers release medical ethanol test results for legal purposes?,The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule allows healthcare providers in certain circumstances to disclose necessary medical information about a patient to law enforcement if they believe the patient presents a serious danger to himself or other people. State rules regarding release of medical test results for legal purposes vary.
Does everyone metabolize alcohol at the same rate?,"A general rule of thumb is one drink equivalent an hour, but there is individual variation due to differences in factors such as race, sex, body weight, use of legal or illegal drugs that interact with alcohol, and food consumption."
Is there anything I can do to get rid of the alcohol in my system faster?,"No, alcohol must be metabolized and eliminated by the liver and the rate at which this happens is regulated by the liver. Food will slow the absorption of ethanol and coffee may make someone who is intoxicated feel more alert, but neither will speed up the process."
Will my ENA autoantibodies ever go away?,"Levels may fluctuate, but once a person has developed an autoantibody, he or she will continue to have it."
Can the ENA panel be performed at my healthcare practitioner's office?,No. The ENA tests require specialized equipment and skilled laboratory personnel. Your sample will need to be sent to a reference laboratory that performs these tests.
"My doctor ordered only a 4-test ENA panel, not a 6-test ENA panel.  Will something be missed?","The panel performed will usually be the one offered by the laboratory that tests your sample. If a 4-test panel is ordered and your doctor is interested in additional tests, he or she can order the others separately as needed to ensure that nothing is missed."
"In addition to factor V Leiden and PT 2010, what other tests might be done to evaluate excessive clotting?","Several other tests may be used to help identify additional factors that may be contributing to excessive clotting (thrombophilia). Some of these include:

Lupus anticoagulant (LAC)
Protein C and protein S
Antithrombin
Methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene mutation
Homocysteine
Factor V gene R2 mutation"
Should someone with a factor V Leiden mutation be on long-term anticoagulant therapy?,"In general, no. Anticoagulant therapy is used when there is DVT and/or VTE. Long-term therapy may be considered for specific individuals, dependent upon the clinical situation. It should be noted that knowing whether a person with DVT/VTE has a factor V Leiden or prothrombin 20210 mutation does not change the intensity or duration of anticoagulant therapy."
Will factor V Leiden or PT 20210 ever go away?,"No. If you have one of these mutations, they are part of your genetic make-up and they will not go away. However, there are things you can do to lower your risk of developing a blood clot, such as not smoking."
"If my doctor tells me to eat 100 grams of fat a day, can I vary it between 50 and 150 grams?  ","You should try to follow your healthcare provider's recommendations as closely as possible. Eating a similar amount of fat each day will help ensure that the interpretation of your results is accurate. For more information on the fat content of various foods, visit the page on Food Exchange Lists by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute."
Can I just do the screening fecal fat test and not the 72-hour test?,"If the screening test is positive, then the 72-hour test is not generally necessary. However, if it is negative, then your healthcare provider may want the additional information that the 72-hour sample provides."
Can the fecal fat test be done in my doctor's office?,The qualitative fecal fat test may be done in a healthcare provider's office if it has the proper stain and equipment. The quantitative test is not performed by all labs. You sample may be sent to a reference laboratory for testing.
"Other than stool tests, are there other ways of screening for colon cancer?","Yes. There are imaging tests that may be used for the detection of precancerous polyps and colon cancer. One of these procedures may be chosen instead of screening annually with a fecal occult blood test:

Colonoscopy is recommended by most health organizations as the preferred method of screening for colon cancer. It involves a thorough examination of the rectum and entire colon using a flexible tube. If polyps or potentially cancerous areas are found, they may be removed during the procedure and examined by a pathologist to see if cancer is present. It is recommended every 10 years for average-risk individuals. Colonoscopy however requires significant preparation, is invasive, and is much costlier than tests for occult blood in the stool. In individuals with abnormal results on screening tests such as FOBT, colonoscopy is then used as a diagnostic test for colon cancer.
Sigmoidoscopy is an examination of the rectum and lower colon with a lighted instrument. It also allows for the removal of any polyps. If this is the chosen method of screening, once every 5 to 10 years is recommended.
CT colonoscopy (virtual colonoscopy) is a less invasive procedure that uses computed tomography (a CT scan) to visualize the entire colon. The recommended screening interval is 5 years.
Capsule colonoscopy is a procedure which uses a vitamin-sized capsule that is swallowed and contains a wireless camera that transmits pictures as it travels through the digestive tract. Not enough evidence is available on this test yet and it is not widely available. If chosen for screening, it should be done every 5 years. "
Are there over-the-counter (OTC) at-home FOBTs and are they just as good as stool tests performed by laboratories?,"Several home FOBT tests are available and while they are fairly sensitive, your healthcare practitioner may prefer a test performed by laboratories. Laboratory professionals are more experienced than most people in interpreting results and are more familiar with sources of false-negative and false-positive results. Read the article With Home Testing, Consumers Take Charge of Their Health to find out more about the pros and cons of home tests."
What kind of procedures might follow a positive FOBT or FIT?,"An FOBT or FIT may be preceded or followed by a digital rectal exam to detect any growths that may be present in the rectum. The DRE is primarily performed to examine the prostate gland in men but also allows for the examination of the lower rectum, pelvis, and belly. Most colon cancers, however, are beyond the detection range of a DRE.
It is recommended that a positive FOBT or FIT be followed by colonoscopy, which enables the healthcare practitioner to examine the entire colon and to identify and remove any precancerous polyps or cancerous areas."
"My iron level is normal, but my ferritin level is low. Why is that?","The development of iron deficiency anemia is a gradual process. If your body is not taking in enough iron, your body first uses the iron that is stored in tissues (i.e., ferritin) and blood levels of ferritin will begin to decrease. If not corrected, the stored iron begins to be depleted as it is used in the production of red blood cells. In the early stages of iron-deficiency, blood levels of iron can be normal while stored iron, and therefore ferritin levels, will begin to decrease."
"I know eating foods high in iron or taking iron supplements will increase my iron level, but will it also increase my ferritin level?","Yes. Taking in more iron will increase the level of iron in your body. If the level of iron in your body increases and is more than your body requires, then your body will begin to store more iron in the form of ferritin."
What other conditions may alter ferritin levels?,"Increased levels may be seen in alcohol abuse, acute hepatitis, and infections."
Who should take iron supplements?,"The people who typically need iron supplements are pregnant women and those with documented iron deficiency. Young women who become anemic due to poor dietary intake and have chronic and/or excessive loss of blood during their menstrual cycle may require iron supplements. People should not take iron supplements before talking to their healthcare practitioner as excess iron can cause chronic iron overload. An overdose of iron pills can be toxic, especially to children."
Is there any way to cure iron overload?,"If it is due to a temporary condition or ingestion of iron supplements, then it will likely resolve on its own once the condition is resolved or supplement ingestion is stopped. If it is due to hemochromatosis or to a chronic disease, then it cannot be cured; careful management by your healthcare practitioner is required. In severe cases, periodic removal of a prescribed amount of blood, also known as therapeutic phlebotomy, may be necessary."
What are the risk factors for preterm labor and delivery?,"There are a number of risk factors, but the greatest risk seems to be to women who:

Have had a previous preterm delivery
Are pregnant with multiples
Have a short cervix

Other risk factors include:

Late or no prenatal care
Having certain chronic conditions, such as high blood pressure or diabetes
Having certain problems with the uterus, cervix, or placenta
Having certain infections during the pregnancy
Being underweight or overweight before pregnancy, or gaining too little or too much weight during pregnancy
Smoking, drinking alcohol, or using illicit drugs
Being the victim of abuse or other stressful events
Having multiple miscarriages

Maternal age (less than 18 or more than 40 years) and race seem also to be factors, with African American women at significantly higher risk than Caucasian or Hispanic women."
Why not use the fFN test after 35 weeks?,"Because fFN levels normally rise as full-term delivery nears and because a baby who is born at or near full term is less likely to suffer premature complications, testing this late in pregnancy is not generally recommended."
What other tests are used to help determine the risk of preterm delivery?,Other tests include measurement of cervical length as determined by transvaginal ultrasonography and testing for bacterial vaginosis.
"What are congenital (inherited) dysfibrinogenemia, hypofibrinogenemia and afibrinogenemia?","These are a rare inherited coagulation disorders caused by changes (mutations) in the genes controlling the production of fibrinogen in the liver.

Congenital dysfibrinogenemia causes the liver to make an abnormal, dysfunctional fibrinogen, one that resists degradation when converted to fibrin or cannot function normally in the coagulation cascade. Dysfibrinogenemia may increase a person's risk of a blood clot or, rarely, cause a mild bleeding tendency. People with fibrinogen deficiency or dysfibrinogenemia may experience poor wound healing.
Congenital hypofibrinogenemia results in decreased fibrinogen. People with this condition can experience mild bleeding episodes, such as a bloody nose or bleeding gums.
Congenital afibrinogenemia is a severe lack of fibrinogen. People with this condition may be at risk of severe bleeding (hemorrhaging) episodes, especially as babies or as young children. They may experience excessive bleeding from the umbilical cord, frequent, easy bruising, nose bleeds that are difficult to stop, excessive bleeding after surgical procedures, and bleeding in the digestive tract.

Genetic testing is occasionally performed for people with these inherited disorders to identify the genetic mutation responsible. Testing for this mutation may also be performed for other family members."
"If my fibrinogen level is increased, what can I do to reduce it?","If your fibrinogen concentration is elevated due to an acute inflammatory process, it will likely return to normal once the underlying condition has resolved. If it is due to an acquired condition such as rheumatoid arthritis, there may be very little you can do to affect the level.
If your healthcare provider has told you that elevated fibrinogen levels are increasing your risk of cardiovascular disease, you can make lifestyle changes that will affect other cardiac risk factors, such as reducing your LDL cholesterol and raising your HDL cholesterol. There is also some evidence that diets rich in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids (fish oils) may help reduce fibrinogen levels."
"What is the difference between tests for fibrinogen, d-dimer, and fibrin degradation products (FDP)?","Fibrinogen activity testing evaluates the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin; fibrinogen antigen testing measures the amount of soluble Factor I (dissolved in the blood) before it has been turned into insoluble fibrin and been crosslinked into a fibrin net. D-dimer and FDP testing both help evaluate the status of the fibrinolytic system, the body's ability to break blood clots apart when they are no longer needed so that they can be removed. FDP is a measurement of all fragments of the dissolving clot, while D-dimer is a more specific measurement for one of the final crosslinked, break-down fragments."
Can I have decreased or abnormal fibrinogen and not know it?,"Yes. Many people have relatively normal clotting even when fibrinogen concentrations and/or activity are low. Your condition may not be identified unless you bleed longer than expected after a surgical procedure or trauma or have coagulation-related testing performed for another reason, such as part of a pre-surgical screen."
"If I have the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene, should my family members be tested?",No. The chromosome deletion that leads to the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion is what is known as somatic. It is a mutation acquired during a person's lifetime and cannot be inherited.
Should everyone with leukemia be tested?,"Testing is only indicated when you have an elevated number of eosinophils (hypereosinophilia, HE) and your healthcare practitioner needs to find the cause. The majority of people with leukemia do not have the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene."
Are there other genetic abnormalities associated with neoplastic hypereosinophilia or hypereosinophilic syndrome (HE/HES)?,"Yes, besides the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene is the most common, there are other mutations that can cause malignant disorders associated with eosinophilia. They include abnormalities of the genes FDGFRB or FGFR1. Similar to PDGFRA, those mutations lead to excess production of the enzyme tyrosine kinase, which is responsible for overactive cell growth. As with FIP1L1-PDGFRA, people with FDGFRB abnormalities respond well to treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, while those with FGFR1 generally do not. Tests for other genetic abnormalities associated with eosinophilia may be done as part of a panel for myeloproliferative disorders or eosinophilia or may be ordered separately based on the judgment of the healthcare practitioner."
What other tests may be done to rule out secondary (reactive) causes of increased eosinophils?,"Before testing for genetic causes of increased number of eosinophils, your healthcare practitioner will rule out more common causes like allergies, asthma, medication, or parasites and other secondary causes like T-cell lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, other myeloproliferative neoplasms, and leukemias. Since allergic diseases are the most common cause of increased eosinophils in the developed world, you will likely be given allergy blood tests. Especially if you have been traveling, your stool may be tested for parasites with an ova and parasites exam. Depending on your symptoms, further blood tests may be done to look for other abnormalities like elevated serum vitamin B12, which would indicate a myeloproliferative disorder and possibly lead to a bone marrow biopsy."
"If HE or HES is suspected, what other lab tests in may be done in addition to FIP1L1-PDGFRA?","Tests for FIP1L1-PDGFRA may be performed along with other genetic tests for less common mutations related to eosinophilia. It may also be performed along with:

Chromosome analysis – to detect other genetic abnormalities that may be the cause of HE/HES, such as PDGFRB or FGFR1 rearrangement. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) is also used to detect chromosome abnormalities.
BCR-ABL1 – if chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is suspected and thus needs to be ruled out
KIT mutation – to rule out mutation in the KIT gene; people with KIT D816 mutation (mastocytosis) do not respond to imatinib treatment.
Interleukin-5 – may be tested because, if elevated, it suggests clonal T-cell disease when found with HES.
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) level – people with elevated IgE levels may have a lower risk of developing hypereosinophilic syndrome-associated cardiovascular disease and may respond well to steroid therapy.
An initial evaluation of HES may include cardiac tests to look for evidence of organ damage from the condition and a troponin test to make sure imatinib won't cause cardiac shock.
Imaging studies – if an underlying solid tumor or lymphoma is suspected"
What are some types of lab methods used for this testing?,"Different types of tests may be ordered to detect FIP1L1-PDGFRA. Samples may be analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The FISH method uses fluorescent dye-labeled probes to detect the deletion of the portion of DNA (4q12, CHIC2 region) that results in the abnormal gene sequence, whereas the RT-PCR method directly detects the FIP1L1-PDGFRA gene sequence when it is present. Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based testing can also be used to detect FIP1L1-PDGFRA."
Are there other non-invasive screening tests for these disorders?,"A newer test called cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) only requires a blood sample from the pregnant woman and can be used to screen for certain fetal chromosome disorders, including Down syndrome, Edwards syndrome, and Patau syndrome (trisomy 13). It can be performed as early as the tenth week of pregnancy. Invasive diagnostic tests such as chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and amniocentesis are still needed to confirm the results of cffDNA. Since cffDNA screening is a relatively new test, some insurance companies may not cover it and it may not be available everywhere. For more information, see the article on Cell-Free Fetal DNA Testing."
I am pregnant; will I have both first and second trimester screening performed?,"There are several approaches to screening depending on what technology is available where you are and when you first visit your healthcare practitioner for prenatal care. Options include:
• First trimester screening for chromosome abnormalities using the combined tests for PAPP-A, hCG and nuchal translucency ultrasound (first-trimester Down syndrome screen), followed by a blood test for maternal AFP and/or a fetal ultrasound in the second trimester to check for neural tube defects
• Second trimester maternal serum screening (triple or quad screen) to assess risk for chromosome abnormalities and neural tube defects; this may be the only testing done, especially in the case of women who do not visit their healthcare practitioner until the second trimester.
• Cell-free fetal DNA testing in the first or second trimester, followed by a blood test for maternal AFP and/or a fetal ultrasound in the second trimester to check for neural tube defects
Typically, if first trimester screening for chromosome disorders has been performed, then screening in the second trimester is not performed because the risks for Down syndrome and Edwards syndrome have already been assessed. However, if you and your healthcare practitioner wish to use the results of both the first trimester Down syndrome screen combined tests and the second trimester maternal serum screen to assess the risk of chromosome abnormalities, then one of the following approaches is used:
• Integrated screening – involves performing both first trimester Down syndrome screening and second trimester maternal serum screening and not releasing the results until all testing is completed
• Sequential screening – involves performing a first trimester screen; if the screen indicates increased risk for Down syndrome or Edwards syndrome, a diagnostic procedure such as chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is offered. If the screen does not indicate increased risk, then a quad screen in the second trimester is offered and results from both the first and second trimester screens are used in the final risk assessment."
I’m having a hard time getting pregnant. What tests do I need?,"Basic tests for infertility often include measuring FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels. Your healthcare provider may also ask you to keep track of your body temperature, which rises slightly during ovulation. Other hormonal tests as well as a postcoital (after intercourse) examination may be done. A hysterosalpingogram (image of fallopian tubes) may be ordered to see whether your fallopian tubes are blocked. Your partner may be asked to give a specimen of semen for analysis."
Why would a man need a test for FSH and LH? I thought these were female hormones.,"Men also produce FSH and LH. These hormone levels are important for male reproduction too. In men, FSH stimulates the testicles to produce sperm just as in women FSH stimulates the ovaries to produce eggs. In men, LH can be measured if testosterone levels are low."
Is there a home test for FSH?,"Yes. There is an FDA-approved self-test that measures the level of FSH in a urine sample. It is used as an indicator of menopause and perimenopause, which are associated with a rise in FSH levels. For more information, see this FDA website."
What are the signs and symptoms of fragile X syndrome?,"Signs and symptoms of fragile X syndrome can vary from person to person and evolve over time. Examples include:

Impaired thinking (cognition), ranging from relatively mild learning disabilities to severe intellectual disability
Development delays
Delay in speech and language skills, especially in boys
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
Features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) that affect communication and social interaction
Behavioral issues related to ADHD or ASD include, for example, hand flapping, anxiety, sensitivity to touch, not making eye contact, difficulty paying attention, acting and speaking without thinking, and being very active.
Anxiety, depression, aggression, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)
Seizures
Chronic ear infections
Distinctive physical features, especially in males as they get older, including a long and narrow face, large ears, a prominent jaw and forehead, unusually flexible fingers, flat feet, and enlarged testicles after puberty"
How common is fragile X syndrome?,"Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited intellectual disability in men and is a significant cause of intellectual disability in women. It occurs in approximately 1 in 4,000 men and 1 in 8,000 women. About half of people with fragile X syndrome also have autism spectrum disorder. Fragile X syndrome accounts for about 2 to 5 percent of all people with autism spectrum disorder."
Is there a cure for fragile X syndrome?,"Currently, there is no way to cure or prevent fragile X syndrome. However, there are educational and occupational therapies as well as symptom support available to improve quality of life for people with the condition."
Does anything else besides an expanded triplet repeat cause fragile X syndrome?,"The vast majority of the time, an expanded triplet repeat of CGG near the FMR1 gene causes fragile X syndrome. Less than 1% of people diagnosed with fragile X syndrome lack that kind of mutation and instead have a different type of FMR1 mutation."
Can a fructosamine test be used to screen for diabetes?,"No. Since the fructosamine levels of people with well-controlled diabetes may overlap with those of people who are not diabetic, the fructosamine test is not useful as a screening test for diabetes."
Can I test for fructosamine at home?,"No. Although a home test was available in the past, it was discontinued in 2002."
Do I need to fast for a fructosamine test?,"No. Since it measures glycated protein and determines the average glucose over the past 2-3 weeks, the fructosamine test is not affected by food that you have eaten during the day. It can be measured at any time during the day."
Shouldn't someone with a family history of diabetes have a fructosamine test?,"No. Unlike A1c, this test is not recommended for diabetes screening, even if they have a strong family history."
"If I have diabetes, should I have a fructosamine test?","The vast majority of people with diabetes can be monitored using A1c tests that reflect their glycemic control over the previous 2 to 3 months. Fructosamine testing can be useful during pregnancy when the woman has diabetes, when a person's red blood cells have a shortened lifespan, and in some cases of people with abnormal forms of hemoglobin. Most diabetics will never need to have the test performed."
"If I have a persistent cough and fever, why would my healthcare provider ask me where I have been traveling and what activities I have been doing?","Some fungi are found in distinct geographical regions, such in the southwestern U.S. or midwestern U.S. If you have been around excavation or spelunking in caves, you may have been exposed to fungal spores. This can be true, even if travel was not recent. Lung infections caused by some fungi may emerge months to even years after exposure. (For more on this, see Travelers' Diseases.)"
"If my healthcare provider thinks I have a fungal infection, why am I being tested for tuberculosis? ","Many of the signs and symptoms associated with fungal lung infections could also be due to a tuberculosis infection. Generally, a healthcare practitioner would order tuberculosis testing (such as an AFB smear and culture) to rule out infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (the bacteria that cause tuberculosis) as the cause of your symptoms. The organisms that cause both fungal lung infections and tuberculosis tend to be slow-growing, both in the body and in the laboratory."
Will my fungal infection eventually resolve itself without treatment? ,"Some may, but most persist without treatment. Lung and systemic infections may grow progressively worse and cause permanent tissue and organ damage even when symptoms are not severe. Some deep infections are almost uniformly fatal without treatment."
Is it really necessary to continue treatment for a long period of time? ,"Yes. Even if you start feeling better in a short period of time, you should follow your healthcare provider's recommendations. While yeast infections may resolve within a few days to weeks, some fungal infections may require months or even years of consistent treatment."
Why is the detection of G6PD deficiency important?,"The detection allows people to work with their healthcare practitioner and to educate themselves about a condition that will affect them to some degree for their entire lives. It also allows people to talk to the healthcare practitioner about how this trait is inherited and the potential impact it may have on their children. By knowing about the deficiency and avoiding potential triggering substances and situations, most of those who have G6PD deficiencies can lead relatively normal lives."
Are there ways to test for G6PD deficiency other than enzyme testing?,"Yes, genetic G6PD testing may sometimes be done within a family to help identify the relevant mutation in women who are carriers (such as the mother of an affected son or daughter of an affected father) when one or more male family members have a G6PD deficiency. If a G6PD genetic mutation is detected, the person will likely have some degree of G6PD deficiency and may experience symptoms that range from nonexistent to acute and severe to chronic at various times throughout the person's life. An affected man will pass the mutation on to his daughter, who will be a carrier. A heterozygous/carrier woman has a 50% chance of passing it on to each of her children. A homozygous woman with two mutated X chromosomes will pass one of her mutations to all of her children. The mutation(s) will be the same within the family and may be common in a geographic region. [For more information on genetic testing, see The Universe of Genetic Testing]."
Is it important to determine which mutation I have?,"Not for you personally, but it may aid in detecting the mutation in other family members. Genetic testing usually only tests for the most common mutations. If you have a specific mutation, then testing other family members for that mutation is useful in establishing familial patterns."
Do I need to tell a new healthcare provider that I have a G6PD deficiency if I do not have any symptoms?,"Yes, this is an important part of your medical history and will affect future medical procedures and treatment options. Your healthcare practitioner needs to know if you have a G6PD deficiency or if you know that you are an asymptomatic carrier. A variety of medications can worsen a hemolytic episode, requiring immediate attention that could include a blood transfusion."
Can my GGT level be elevated if I don't have any symptoms?,"Yes, GGT is very sensitive and can be increased when you don't have symptoms. This elevation may be temporary, perhaps due to medications that you are taking or due to drinking alcohol within 24 hours of the test. If other liver enzymes are normal, your healthcare practitioner may choose to repeat the GGT test at a later date. If the GGT is very high and/or your other liver enzymes are elevated, it may be necessary to have additional testing to identify the cause."
"I am an alcoholic, but I have quit drinking. Will my GGT ever go back to normal?","Over time, your GGT level will fall from whatever level it was at when you stopped drinking alcohol to within the normal range. This can take several weeks to more than a month. Abstaining from alcohol will decrease your chances of further damaging your liver and should allow your liver function to improve."
Can this test be performed in my healthcare practitioner’s office?,"No, it requires specialized equipment and expertise. It may be performed in a local laboratory if it is offered or may need to be sent to a reference laboratory."
Why would my healthcare provider order additional tests?,"Additional testing may be done to confirm a positive result using another method, to perform susceptibility testing when required, or because the cause of your symptoms has not yet been identified."
"Why did I get sick eating something when I travelled internationally, but the locals who ate the same thing did not get sick?","Some of the bacteria strains encountered have been previously ingested by local inhabitants, who are now immune to these pathogens, but cause gastrointestinal distress to the tourist."
Can a blood sample from a fingerstick be used to diagnose diabetes?,"No, fingerstick blood samples are not appropriate for diagnosing diabetes. Rather, a blood sample drawn from a vein should be used for diagnostic testing. However, fingerstick samples may be used to monitor your glucose levels if you have been diagnosed with diabetes."
Can glucose testing be done when I have not fasted?,"You may have non-fasting glucose testing in certain situations:

A blood sample collected after a fast of at least 8 hours is preferred when using a glucose test for screening and diagnosing diabetes. However, you may sometimes have your blood drawn for a routine metabolic panel that includes a glucose test (e.g., CMP, BMP) when you have not fasted for 8 hours. In this case, if the glucose result is above the cutoff level, then additional testing, such as repeating the glucose test after fasting, may be required.
If you have been diagnosed with diabetes, you may be instructed to check your glucose levels after you have eaten as part of monitoring and controlling your glucose levels over time."
I’ve recently been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Will I need to monitor my glucose levels every day?,"Your healthcare practitioner will discuss with you whether you need to monitor your glucose levels. Not everyone with type 2 diabetes needs to monitor their glucose levels every day, especially if they are able to manage their diabetes and glucose levels with diet and exercise.
However, some people with type 2 diabetes must check their blood glucose levels, sometimes several times a day. This may be done using a glucose meter. You would place a drop of blood from a skin prick onto a glucose strip and then insert the strip into the glucose meter, a small machine that provides a digital readout of the blood glucose level. Alternatively, some people may use a continuous glucose monitoring device.
Your healthcare practitioner will give you guidelines for how high or low your blood sugar should be at different times of the day. By checking your glucose regularly, you can see if the diet and medication schedule you are following is working properly for you."
Can I test my blood glucose levels at home?,"If you have not been diagnosed with diabetes or prediabetes, there is usually no reason to test glucose levels at home. Screening done as part of your regular physical should be sufficient.
If you have been diagnosed with diabetes, however, your healthcare practitioner or diabetes educator may recommend a home glucose monitor (glucometer or continuous glucose monitoring device) so that you can test your blood glucose levels at home. By checking your glucose regularly, you can see if the diet and medication schedule you are following is working properly for you."
Can urine samples be tested for glucose?,"Urine samples are routinely tested for glucose as part of a urinalysis. Additional testing is usually done to identify the cause of an abnormal urine glucose result.
Glucose usually only shows up in the urine if glucose is at sufficiently high levels in the blood that some of the excess is lost in the urine, or if there is some degree of kidney damage and the glucose is leaking out into the urine."
"Besides blood and urine, can other body fluids be tested for glucose?","Yes, but the purpose and meaning of results are different for each type of fluid. For more details see the article Body Fluid Testing with links to related articles."
"Besides glucose, what other tests might be done?","Hemoglobin A1c is an indicator of long-term glucose control that is commonly ordered in patients with prediabetes and diabetes and can also be used as a screening test. Other less common tests, such as islet autoantibodies, insulin, and C-peptide, may sometimes be performed along with these tests to help determine the cause of abnormal glucose levels, to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and to evaluate insulin production."
How can a diabetes educator help me?,"A diabetes educator (often a nurse with specialized training) can make sure that you know how to:

Recognize and know how to treat both high and low blood sugar
Test and record your self-check glucose values
Adjust your medications
Administer insulin (which types in which combinations to meet your needs)
Handle medications when you get ill
Monitor your feet, skin, and eyes to catch diabetes-related health problems early
Buy diabetic supplies and store them properly
Plan meals; diet is extremely important in minimizing swings in blood glucose levels. A registered dietician can help you learn how to plan meals and a diabetes educator can help with this as well."
How is hypoglycemia diagnosed?,"A medical diagnosis of hypoglycemia typically requires satisfying the ""Whipple triad."" These three criteria include:

Documented low glucose levels (less than 40 mg/dL (2.2 mmol/L), often tested along with insulin levels and sometimes with C-peptide levels)
Symptoms of hypoglycemia when the blood glucose level is abnormally low
Reversal of the symptoms when blood glucose levels are returned to normal

Primary hypoglycemia is rare and often diagnosed in infancy. People may have symptoms of hypoglycemia without really having low blood sugar. In such cases, dietary changes such as eating frequent small meals and several snacks a day and choosing complex carbohydrates over simple sugars may be enough to ease symptoms."
"If I am diagnosed with gestational diabetes, will I need to monitor my glucose levels?","If you have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes, your healthcare practitioner will recommend that you monitor your blood glucose levels to determine how far above or below normal your glucose is and to determine if you need diabetes medications.
Home glucose monitoring at regular intervals is typically recommended. This is usually done using a small instrument called a glucometer and testing strips. You would check your glucose by inserting the test strip into the glucometer and then placing a drop of blood from a skin prick onto the glucose strip. The glucometer then provides a digital readout of your blood glucose level. You will be given guidelines for how high or low your blood sugar should be at different times of the day. By checking your glucose regularly, you can see if the diet and medication schedule you are following is working properly for you."
"Once I have gestational diabetes, will I continue to have diabetes after delivery?","Gestational diabetes usually goes away after you deliver your baby, but you will be at increased risk of developing diabetes later in your life. Some women have diabetes before becoming pregnant and don't know it. For these women, diabetes will not go away after delivering their baby."
Will I have gestational diabetes with subsequent pregnancies?,"You may. If you've had gestational diabetes, your chance of developing it with subsequent pregnancies is increased."
What does the glucose drink taste like?,The glucose solution typically tastes similar to a very sweet soda. Substitutes for the glucose drink are not recommended.
Can I drink water before or during the test?,While you should fast—nothing to eat or drink for 8 to 14 hours before your test—small sips of water are usually permissible.
"If I get treated, can I get gonorrhea again?","Yes. Even though treatment will cure your infection, you can get it again if you are exposed again. In fact, reinfection is common, according to the CDC."
Should I tell my partner that I have gonorrhea?,"Yes, you should tell your sexual partner(s) that you have gonorrhea so that they can get tested and treated."
Does having gonorrhea put me at greater risk for other STDs?,"Yes, if you are infected, your risk of contracting other sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, is increased."
Why isn't a Gram stain performed on all samples sent for culture?,"Gram stains are not helpful when the disease-causing bacteria (pathogen) cannot be differentiated from normal bacterial flora. For example, a Gram stain of a sample from the throat cannot tell the healthcare practitioner what bacteria are causing the infection because both the ""good bacteria"" and the ""bad bacteria"" look the same under the microscope."
What happens if my healthcare practitioner needs more information than the Gram stain provides?,"The Gram stain is usually done in conjunction with a culture and may be followed by susceptibility testing. This allows for more exact identification of the bacteria causing the infection and determination of the most appropriate antibiotic. Several other tests are available to help make a diagnosis, including antigen and antibody testing, and molecular tests that detect the genetic material of the bacteria."
"In addition to growth hormone testing, what other laboratory tests might be done?","Other blood tests that may be used to evaluate pituitary gland function include prolactin, free T4 or total T4, TSH, cortisol, FSH, LH, and/or testosterone. These tests are usually performed prior to GH testing to make sure that they are normal and/or controlled with medication before GH testing is done. For example, hypothyroidism must be treated prior to testing for GH deficiency in children; otherwise, a falsely low GH result may be seen.
Other tests, such as insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), are sometimes ordered to help evaluate GH production."
Why would athletes be tested for growth hormone?,"Growth hormone promotes muscle growth in adults, so it may be taken by some adults as a performance-enhancing drug. Athletes may be tested for GH or IGF-1 when they are being tested for other performance-enhancing drugs. (See the article on Drugs of Abuse for more on sports-related testing.)"
What conditions or other factors can affect haptoglobin levels?,"Haptoglobin is considered an ""acute-phase"" protein. This means that it will be elevated in many inflammatory diseases, such as ulcerative colitis, acute rheumatic disease, heart attack, and severe infection. If you have one of these conditions, it can complicate the interpretation of the haptoglobin results. Haptoglobin testing is not generally used to help diagnose or monitor these conditions.
Haptoglobin levels may be affected by massive blood loss and by conditions associated with kidney dysfunction as well as liver disease.
Drugs that can increase haptoglobin levels include androgens and corticosteroids. Drugs that can decrease haptoglobin concentrations include isoniazid, quinidine, streptomycin, and birth control pills."
"If my haptoglobin level is low, when will it return to normal?","It depends on the cause of the low level. If it is due to acute hemolysis, such as may be seen with a transfusion reaction, then it will return to normal once the reaction resolves. If it is due to chronic hemolysis, then the level should return to normal if and when the underlying condition can be resolved. If the underlying condition cannot be resolved or if the decreased level of haptoglobin is due to decreased production due to liver disease, then the level may continue to be lower than normal."
Can I have the haptoglobin test done in my healthcare practitioner's office?,"In most cases, no. This test is typically either performed in a hospital laboratory or sent to a reference laboratory."
Is a haptoglobin test used for anything else?,"The haptoglobin test may be also ordered inside the laboratory to differentiate between a hemolyzed specimen due to RBCs' destruction inside the body from a hemolyzed specimen due RBCs' destruction after a blood draw. However, few studies have been found that support this use."
Can urine be tested instead of blood?,"If hCG is elevated in the blood, then it will be elevated in the urine, but the results are not interchangeable. Blood is the preferred sample for tumor testing."
Can I have a normal pregnancy after having GTD?,"Yes, in most cases, although you will be at a higher risk of having GTD again. After treatment for GTD, you will need to wait for a period of time as advised by your healthcare provider before becoming pregnant again."
I heard that some athletes may be tested for hCG. Why is that?,"Some athletes, including professional and international athletes, must submit to tests that detect steroids and other performance-enhancing substances. These athletes are often tested throughout their careers to ensure that no 'doping' occurs. Urine tests can detect about 200 compounds, including steroids and other anabolic substances, erythropoietin, and substances that cause false-negative results (masking agents) to hide illicit substance use. Sports organizations specify which compounds they might be looking for by doing a complete screen.
Some athletes who use steroids take beta-hCG to reverse shrinking of their testicles, which can be a side effect of steroids. Thus, some athletes may be tested for hCG to help identify steroid use. (For more on this, see the article on Drug Abuse Testing.)"
Can my HDL-C be too high?,"High HDL-C has generally been found to be protective, decreasing the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in most people. However, some recent studies have shown that in some people with high HDL-C, the HDL-C is not protective and may, in fact, result in higher risk for CAD than in people with normal HDL-C levels. In one study, it was shown that people with CAD and high HDL-C had underlying genetic anomalies in enzymes important in lipid turnover (cholesterol ester transfer protein and hepatic triglyceride lipase). Another study showed that high levels of abnormally large HDL-C particles were associated with an increased risk of CAD. Further research is needed to determine what conditions contribute to an unexpectedly high risk of CAD in the presence of high HDL-C."
How is someone exposed to toxic metals?,"Heavy metals can be absorbed through the skin, inhaled, or by eating or drinking contaminated food or liquids. You can be poisoned when the metals displace the essential elements in the body and begin to affect the normal function of various organs. Most people will never be sufficiently exposed to be harmed or require testing.
The majority of short-term and long-term exposures occur in the workplace, especially in industries that use metals to manufacture products; such as the cadmium, lead, and mercury used in batteries and the arsenic used in some pesticides. Exposures can also occur in agricultural workers, in people whose job it is to clean up contaminated environmental sites, in those who work with certain products such as auto mechanics working with car batteries, and in those with hobbies that involve the use of metals such as the lead used by stained glass artisans.
Pregnant women at risk of metal toxicity such as lead can pass metals to their developing babies (fetuses). This is because lead is able to cross the placenta. Also, lead can be passed to infants through breast milk. When mothers should and should not to breastfeed will depend on blood lead levels.
Most exposures to excessive concentrations in the general population are primarily due to increased levels of metals in food or water, products that they use, or soil contamination in or near the areas that they work and live."
"How can I test my soil, water, or the paint on my house for heavy metals? ",See the links under Related Content and explore the Environmental Protection Agency website. The EPA has information that can help you find a professional to evaluate your environment.
"In addition to lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium and chromium, what are some other metals that may be tested?","Some metals that are tested less frequently in suspected toxicity include:

Aluminum
Beryllium
Cobalt
Copper
Iron
Manganese
Nickel
Platinum
Selenium
Silicon
Silver
Thallium"
Does everyone with H. pylori get ulcers?,"No, many people have evidence of infection but have no symptoms of ulcerative disease. The reason why some people with H. pylori infections develop peptic ulcers and others do not is not yet understood."
Should everyone be tested for H. pylori?,"Since the infection is very common and most people do not ever get ulcers, testing is generally only recommended for those who have signs and symptoms."
How did I get infected with H. pylori?,"The bacteria are believed to be transmitted by eating food or drinking water that has been contaminated with human stool, or possibly through contact with the stool, vomit, or saliva of an infected person. Exposure to family members with H. pylori seems to be the most likely opportunity for transmission."
Why is the blood test for H. pylori antibodies no longer recommended?,"The American Gastroenterology Association, the American College of Gastroenterologists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Society for Microbiology do not recommend the antibody blood test for routine use in diagnosing an H. pylori infection or evaluating its treatment as the test cannot distinguish between a present and previous infection. A few healthcare practitioners still order this test, but many laboratories have stopped offering it. If performed and the blood test is negative, then it is unlikely that the person has had an H. pylori infection. If it is positive, then the presence of a current H. pylori infection should be confirmed with a stool antigen or breath test."
Can my hematocrit be tested at home?,"No. This test requires instrumentation and trained laboratory personnel. A hematocrit is typically indirectly measured (i.e., calculated from RBC and MCV) by automated hematology analyzers. It can also be directly measured by spinning a blood-filled capillary tube in a centrifuge (so-called spun hematocrit), but this manual method is less commonly used."
What other tests may be done in addition to a hematocrit?,"The hematocrit can indicate if there is a problem with RBCs, but it cannot determine the underlying cause. In addition to the full CBC, some other tests that may be performed at the same time or as follow up to establish a cause include a blood smear, reticulocyte count, iron studies, vitamin B12 and folate levels, and in more severe conditions, a bone marrow examination."
Is anyone more at risk for abnormal hematocrit values? ,"Women of childbearing age tend to have lower hematocrit levels than men due to loss of iron and blood during menstrual periods and increased need for iron during pregnancy. People who have a chronic illness such as kidney disease, cancer, HIV/AIDS, chronic infection or autoimmune disorder (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) are at risk for abnormally low hematocrit. Others who are at greater risk of a low hematocrit (anemia) include people with poor nutrition and diets low in iron or vitamins, people who have undergone surgery or people who have been severely injured. Someone who has family members with a genetic cause of anemia such as sickle cell or thalassemia also have a higher risk of having the condition and a higher risk of anemia."
Can I test my hemoglobin at home?,"Yes, there are some home tests currently available that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Home testing offers many benefits, but it's also important to recognize the potential tradeoffs between quality and convenience and to take steps to protect yourself against the possibility of false results, and your own lack of training. Talk to your healthcare practitioner about this type of testing and discuss any questions or concerns you may have. For more about these tests, see the article With Home Testing, Consumers Take Charge of Their Health."
What other tests may be done in addition to hemoglobin?,"A hemoglobin test can indicate if there is a problem with red blood cell production and/or lifespan, but it cannot determine the underlying cause. In addition to the full CBC, some other tests that may be performed at the same time or as follow up to establish a cause include a blood smear, reticulocyte count, iron studies, vitamin B12 and folate levels, and in more severe conditions, a bone marrow examination."
Is anyone at greater risk of abnormal hemoglobin levels?,"Women of childbearing age tend to have lower hemoglobin levels than men due to loss of iron and blood during menstrual periods and increased need for iron during pregnancy. Others who are at greater risk of a low hemoglobin level (anemia) include people with poor nutrition and diets low in iron or vitamins, people who have undergone surgery or have been severely injured, people with chronic conditions such as kidney disease, cancer, HIV/AIDS, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic infection or chronic inflammatory conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). Someone who has family members with a genetic cause of anemia, such as sickle cell or thalassemia, also has a higher risk of having the condition and a higher risk of anemia."
Are there warning signs for abnormally low hemoglobin levels?,"Some warning signs are fatigue, fainting, pale skin (pallor), and shortness of breath."
Can a healthy diet and nutrition help keep optimal hemoglobin levels?,"Yes, to the extent that if you eat a well-balanced diet, you can prevent anemia due to a lack of iron, vitamin B12, or folate in the foods you eat. Sometimes use of a supplement is recommended if you are at risk of a vitamin deficiency. However, the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency is malabsorption, and the most common cause of iron deficiency is bleeding. These conditions and other red blood cell problems that are caused by diseases other than nutritional deficiencies cannot be corrected by diet."
Is there a home test for hemoglobin A1c?,"Yes. If you have already been diagnosed with diabetes, a home test may be used to help monitor your glucose control over time. However, a home test (point-of-care test) is not recommended for screening or diagnosing the disease. There are FDA-approved tests that can be used at home. If you are interested in learning more, visit the article on Home Tests and ask your healthcare provider."
Why are my A1c and blood glucose different?,"Beyond the difference in units used to report them, the A1c represents an average over time while your blood glucose reflects what is happening in your body now. Your blood glucose will capture the changes in your blood sugar that occur on a daily basis, the highs and the lows. Each blood glucose is a snapshot and each is different. The A1c is an indication that ""in general"" your glucose has been elevated over the last few months or ""in general"" it has been normal. It is inherently not as sensitive as a blood glucose. However, if your day-to-day glucose control is stable (good or bad), then both the A1c and blood glucose should reflect this. It is important to remember the time lag associated with the A1c. Good glucose control for the past 2-3 weeks will not significantly affect the A1c result for several more weeks.
In addition to this, it is also important to remember that glycated hemoglobin and blood glucose are two different but related things. For unknown reasons, some peoples' A1c may not accurately reflect their average blood glucose."
How is estimated Average Glucose (eAG) calculated?,"The ADAG (A1c-Derived Average Glucose) formula that is used to calculate the eAG from your hemoglobin A1c (A1c) result is:
    28.7 X A1c (%) – 46.7 = eAG (milligrams/deciliter, mg/dL)
An example of this is an A1c of 6%. The calculation for this would be:
    28.7 X 6 – 46.7 = 126 mg/dL
for an estimated average glucose of 126 mg/dL.
What this means is that for every one percent that your A1c goes up, it is equivalent to your average glucose going up by about 29 mg/dL."
Is A1c reported the same way around the world?,"For monitoring purposes, the way that the A1c is reported is in the process of changing. Traditionally, in the United States, the A1c has been reported as a percentage, and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) has recommended that people with diabetes strive to keep their A1c below 7%. While this is still generally true, more than a decade of national and international efforts to improve and standardize the A1c test and its reporting led to the release of a consensus statement in 2007 (and an update in 2010) by the ADA, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC), the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes, and the International Diabetes Federation. These joint statements and the completion of a study called ADAG (A1c-Derived Average Glucose) that further examined the relationship between blood glucose concentrations and A1c led to a recommendation that A1c be reported worldwide in two ways:

As a percentage (based upon National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) derived units) and
In SI (Système International) units (mmol/mol)
	 

An estimated Average Glucose (eAG) based upon a formula developed from the ADAG study with either mg/dL or mmol/l as units that continue to be recognized by the ADA and the American Association for Clinical Chemistry in the 2015 ADA Diabetes Care Position Statement may also be reported.
What this means for people with diabetes and healthcare practitioners in the U.S. is that A1c results will be reported as a percentage but may in addition to this be reported as mmol/mol and, in some cases, also as an eAG with the same type of units (mg/dL) as are reported by home glucose monitors and laboratory results."
Why is every newborn screened for hemoglobinopathies?,"Newborn screening helps to identify potentially treatable or manageable congenital disorders within days of birth. Potentially life-threatening health problems and serious lifelong disabilities can be avoided or minimized if a condition is quickly identified and treated. Also, since newborn screening programs have mandated testing for certain hemoglobin variants (i.e., Hb S, SC and beta-thalassemia), they have uncovered thousands of children who are carriers. (This is due to new technology, not to an increased prevalence of the gene variants.) Information on carrier status may be important in their future if and when they begin to plan a family."
How long will I have to receive heparin treatment? ,"Unfractionated heparin therapy is usually used for short periods of time to help treat and prevent inappropriate clotting. When long-term anticoagulation is required, other drug therapies such as warfarin are usually used. An exception to this is during pregnancy, when heparin is the preferred anticoagulant, but the need for heparin therapy in this case typically ends around the time of delivery. After delivery, if continued anticoagulation therapy is needed, a healthcare practitioner may consider warfarin or a low molecular weight heparin such as enoxaparin."
Do I need to tell my other healthcare providers that I am receiving heparin?,"Yes, this is information that will be important for healthcare practitioners to know when evaluating you for or determining treatment options for other conditions."
How are the newly approved oral anticoagulation drugs monitored?,"Newly approved oral anticoagulants include direct thrombin inhibitor (e.g., dabigatran) and direct factor Xa inhibitors (e.g., rivaroxaban, apixaban). Routine laboratory monitoring of direct factor Xa inhibitor is not required. If a healthcare practitioner determines that monitoring is necessary, an anti-Xa test that is tailored for these drugs may be used."
Does everyone with HIT antibodies develop HIT II?,"No. In fact, the majority of people who produce HIT antibodies will not develop HIT II (i.e., have significant thrombocytopenia and thrombosis)."
What else can cause a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia)?,"Many conditions and diseases other than HIT can cause thrombocytopenia by affecting your platelet production or increasing platelet loss (destruction). In addition to heparin, there are several other medications that can cause drug-induced thrombocytopenia and antiplatelet antibodies. For more details, read the article on Low Platelets."
Does the type and/or amount of heparin I receive make a difference in my risk for developing HIT?,"There are two types of heparin that may be used in your treatment: standard or unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH). HIT II can develop in anyone receiving UFH but is more likely in those who have had surgery. The condition is rare in children. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) does not generally cause HIT II, but it can. If you have developed HIT II with UFH, then you are more likely to develop HIT with LMWH.
It is rare but possible for you to develop HIT antibodies, even when the only heparin that you have been exposed to is the small amount used to flush out your intravenous line or catheter. "
Can the heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) antibody test be done in my healthcare practitioner's office?,No. It requires specialized equipment and is not offered by every hospital-based laboratory. It may be necessary to send your blood sample to a reference laboratory.
"If I have an HIT antibody, will it eventually go away?","The amount of antibody will generally decrease after several months, but you may develop it again if you are given heparin again due to anamnestic response."
Should I tell all of my healthcare practitioners that I have an HIT antibody?,Yes. This is important information for your healthcare practitioners to know as it may affect other procedures and some of your treatment options.
How could I have gotten the virus without knowing it?,"The virus is passed through contact with stool (fecal matter) from an infected person, typically via contaminated food or water. If a person infected with HAV does not wash their hands after using the bathroom, that person can pass the virus by handling raw fruits and vegetables consumed by others, or directly through person to person contact. You can also contract the virus by eating raw or improperly cooked seafood that had fed in contaminated waters. You may also contract the virus through sexual contact with someone who is infected but asymptomatic."
"If I have hepatitis A, how long will I be contagious?","According to the World Health Organization, you can spread the disease to others roughly 1 to 3 weeks before symptoms, such as jaundice, begin to appear. Symptoms typically develop within 4 weeks but can appear any time between 2 and 6 weeks after you are first infected. You can continue to be contagious, but less so, for several weeks after jaundice develops."
"If I have had a hepatitis A infection, can I get it again?","No, once you have had the disease and develop the IgG class of antibodies, they will provide immunity for the rest of your life."
"If it is possible that I have an HBV infection, will I need to have all these tests done?",No. Your healthcare practitioner will determine which test(s) will be appropriate for your symptoms and history.
Should I get the HBV vaccine?,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that adults in high-risk groups get vaccinated. Some of these groups include people:

In close contact with someone who has hepatitis B
Who undergo dialysis
With chronic liver or kidney disease
With HIV or who seek treatment for other sexually transmitted diseases or drug treatment
Who travel to countries where hepatitis B is common
Who are healthcare workers with potential exposure to HBV

Unless there is something in your medical history to the contrary, it is prudent to get the series of vaccinations. Babies, children and adolescents are routinely given the series of shots; if you have already been vaccinated, you probably are protected for many years, perhaps for life, and will not usually need to get the vaccine again."
"If the disease is very mild, why should I be tested?","Hepatitis C often leads to chronic hepatitis, which can progress to cirrhosis and liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma). Early detection of the virus can alert your healthcare provider to follow your liver function more closely than usual and to treat you if you are chronically infected."
"Besides HCV testing, what other tests might be done?","Healthcare practitioners may also order a liver panel, which is a group of tests that help assess the health of your liver. Liver tests such as ALT and AST may be used to detect ongoing liver injury. You will likely be checked to see if you are immune to hepatitis A and hepatitis B, and if not, you will be offered vaccination, since infection with these other viruses can further damage your liver. Other tests such as albumin, prothrombin time, and bilirubin can also be used. They are typically normal unless you have developed cirrhosis. Sometimes a liver biopsy may be performed to determine the severity of liver damage. If you are going to be treated, you will be checked for exposure or infection with hepatitis B virus, as HCV treatment can cause a flare-up of hepatitis B."
Can I be vaccinated against HCV?,"No. Currently, there is no vaccine available. Although research is ongoing to develop one, most attempts to develop a vaccine have so far been unsuccessful in protecting people."
"Once I have been treated and/or recovered from hepatitis C, can I get infected again?",Yes. A prior infection with HCV does not protect you from another infection—it does not make you immune to HCV. Most people do not have an effective immune response to the virus. Changes that the virus undergoes as it replicates during an infection make it difficult for the body to fight against the initial or subsequent infections.
Can I test myself for HCV at home?,There is an FDA-approved test kit available for collecting samples to send to a laboratory for testing. Confidential test results are provided over the telephone. You cannot actually perform the test yourself at home.
Can this test be done at my healthcare practitioner’s office?,"Maybe. There are rapid HCV antibody tests available that can be done at the point of care (POC), in settings such as your healthcare practitioner’s office, community health clinics, and emergency rooms. They provide results in about 20 minutes. However, a positive result requires confirmation of active disease with an HCV RNA test, which is performed in a laboratory."
How can I tell if I am contagious and can spread the infection to others?,"If you have detectable HCV RNA in your blood, you have the potential to spread the disease to other people. Hepatitis C is spread by exposure to contaminated blood. The most common mechanism of exposure is the sharing of needles or other 'works' used in consuming drugs such as cocaine or heroin. Other routes of transmission include use of contaminated equipment for body piercing and tattooing, occupational exposure of healthcare workers to used needles or other sharp objects, and, less commonly, through sexual activity that results in tissue tears or from mother to baby during childbirth."
"Besides HER2, what other laboratory tests may my healthcare provider order on my breast cancer tissue?","During an initial workup of invasive breast cancer, the pathologist evaluating the tumor will also test the tissue for estrogen and progesterone hormone receptor status (ER and PR). Tumors with positive estrogen and/or progesterone receptor status may have a diminished response to endocrine/hormone therapy if the tumor is also HER2-positive. Your healthcare practitioner may also order a breast cancer gene expression test to learn more about your cancer's characteristics."
Does HER2-targeted therapy work for every tumor that is HER2-positive?,"No. However, HER2-targeted therapy may be combined with other chemotherapy agents to increase effectiveness in many circumstances."
Would this testing also be performed on a man?,"Yes. Men do not get breast cancer as frequently as women, but it does occur and their cancer may also be HER2-positive. Guidelines also recommend HER2 testing for clinical decision-making in patients of any gender with advanced stomach and esophagus cancers who are potential candidates for HER2-targeted therapy."
Can herpes simplex virus cause serious infections?,"Yes. The most serious, or life-threatening, HSV infections can occur in newborns who are infected during birth and in individuals with weakened immune systems (immunocompromised), such as organ transplant recipients and people with HIV/AIDS. Neonatal herpes is a serious condition, but also very rare. While 25-30% of pregnant women have genital herpes, less than 0.1% of babies born in the U.S. each year get neonatal herpes. This means that most women with genital herpes give birth to healthy babies.
HSV lesions (vesicles) tend to be more extensive and persist longer in newborns and immunocompromised people than in individuals who have healthy immune systems."
Are there other types of herpes viruses besides HSV-1 and HSV-2?,"Yes. There are over 25 viruses in the herpes family and at least 8 types that infect humans. These include herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 discussed in this article as well as varicella zoster virus (VZV, HHV-3), associated with chickenpox and shingles, Epstein Barr virus (EBV, HHV-4), which can cause infectious mononucleosis, cytomegalovirus (CMV, HHV-5), human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) and human herpes virus 7 (HHV-7), both associated with roseola in young children, and human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8), which has been found in tumors in people with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). KS primarily affects people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS and organ transplant recipients."
Should I tell my partner that I have herpes?,"Yes, you should tell your sexual partner(s) that you have herpes so that you can follow preventive measures during sex. They may also wish to get tested."
Is hs-CRP specific for predicting heart disease?,"No. CRP is a marker of inflammation, a process that can affect a number of organ systems. Most studies to date have focused on heart disease, but new research shows that having CRP in the high normal range may also be associated with other diseases such as colon cancer, complications of diabetes, and obesity."
I have had cholesterol tests but never an hs-CRP test. Why?,"You may not fall into one of the categories for which the test is currently recommended. Also, experts still don't agree on when and how often the hs-CRP test should be ordered. As more clinical studies are completed that support its utility, this test may be more frequently ordered."
What is the difference between regular CRP and hs-CRP tests?,Both tests measure the same protein in the blood. The hs-CRP test is for apparently healthy people to determine their risk of cardiovascular disease. It measures CRP in the range from 0.5 to 10 mg/L. The CRP test is ordered to evaluate people who have signs and symptoms of a serious bacterial infection or of a serious chronic inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis. It measures CRP in the range from 10 to 1000 mg/L.
What can I do to change my histone antibody level?,"Talk to your healthcare practitioner about discontinuing the potentially offending drug. When this is done, the histone antibody level should drop over time. Histone antibody levels do not respond to lifestyle changes."
"If the level of my histone antibodies decreases, can I take my drug again? ","No. The antibodies may drop to very low or undetectable levels, but a small amount will still exist. If you resume taking your drug, your symptoms and increased antibody levels may reemerge."
Should I tell all my healthcare providers about being diagnosed with drug-induced lupus?,"Yes, this is an important part of your medical history and needs to be shared as it will need to be taken into account by your healthcare practitioners whenever you are given medications."
How long will it take to get the results of my test?,"Depending on where you have your test done, your sample may be sent to a reference laboratory. Results may take one to two weeks."
My healthcare practitioner says my viral load is too low for drug resistance testing. Why?,"HIV drug resistance testing is not recommended if your viral load is less than 500 copies/mL. In this case, there is insufficient amount of HIV genetic material (RNA) for testing to be reliable. Testing works best if the viral load is greater than 1,000 copies/mL, but testing is recommended even if the level is between 500 and 1,000 copies/mL."
How can I get tested for HIV?,"There are a few different ways you can get access to HIV screening:

A blood or saliva sample can be collected in a healthcare practitioner's office or a local clinic and sent to a laboratory for testing. Certain testing centers provide either anonymous (the name is never given) or confidential (the name is given but kept private) HIV testing and counseling. You can also contact your state or local health department to find out where testing may be available. To find a testing site near you, visit the National HIV and STD Testing Resources webpage.
In these same settings, there may be a rapid test available, with results that are generated in 20 minutes or less.
There is a home test for HIV that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It uses a saliva (oral fluid) sample and results are available in about 20 minutes.
	The home test has two limitations:
	1. The saliva test is less sensitive than a blood test, so the home test may miss some cases of HIV that a blood test would detect.
	2. The home test is not as accurate when it is performed at home by a lay person compared to when it is performed by a trained healthcare professional. However, the convenience of home testing might encourage some people who might otherwise be reluctant to go to a healthcare practitioner or clinic to learn their HIV status."
How soon can HIV be detected by a blood test?,It depends on the test. Combination tests that use a blood sample drawn from a vein and detect HIV antigen (p24) and HIV antibodies can detect HIV infections in most people 2 to 6 weeks after infection. Combination tests that use fingerstick blood samples detect HIV infections about 2 to 12 weeks after infection. Blood tests that detect HIV antibody alone can detect infections in most people about 3 to 12 weeks after infection.
Should I tell anyone else of my test results?,"Yes. If you test positive for HIV infection, it is important that you tell your healthcare practitioners as well as all current and future sex partners and/or anyone with whom you share needles. Counseling services are often available from the clinic that performed the test or from your healthcare provider that will help you to inform the people who need to know."
How confidential are HIV test results?,"Your HIV status, like other medical conditions and test results, is protected by the HIPAA Privacy Rule and cannot be shared with friends, family, or employers without your written permission. Your HIV status may be shared with your healthcare providers who have a ""need to know"" in order to treat you. Also, in order to determine the incidence of HIV and to provide appropriate prevention and care services, all new cases of HIV are reported to state and local health departments.
Certain testing centers provide either anonymous (your name is never given) or confidential (your name is given but kept private) HIV testing and counseling. You can also contact your state or local health department to find out where testing may be available."
"If I test positive for HIV, what follow-up tests are performed?","If you are HIV-positive, follow-up tests may include the following:

HIV viral load testing—measures the amount of HIV in the blood. It is performed when you are first diagnosed to help determine the status of the disease and is ordered at intervals to monitor the effectiveness of therapy.
CD4 count—measures the number of CD4 T-cells (lymphocytes) in the blood. It is ordered when you are first diagnosed to get a baseline assessment of your immune system and it is done at intervals to monitor therapy and the status of the immune system.
HIV antiretroviral drug resistance testing, genotypic—ordered when you are initially diagnosed to determine whether the particular strain(s) of HIV that you have is resistant to certain antiretroviral drug therapies. This testing is also ordered when treatment is changed or when there is evidence of treatment failure."
Why should I get tested if I am pregnant?,"If you are pregnant, it is important to determine if you have HIV so you can be treated. Treatment of HIV-infected mothers during pregnancy, precautions at birth, and avoiding breast-feeding can minimize the risk of passing the infection from mother to child. If you are already taking HIV medications when you become pregnant, you should continue to do so during pregnancy and labor and delivery. If you are not taking HIV medications or have a high viral load during pregnancy, giving the antiretroviral drug zidovudine intravenously during labor and delivery and also to the newborn twice a day by mouth for 6 weeks reduces the rate of transmission from 25-33% to about 1-2%."
Can you use the HIV antibody test to detect HIV in newborns?,"No. Because maternal antibodies are transferred from mother to baby and stay in the newborn's system for 6 to 18 months, a different test must be used. A test that detects the genetic material, either an HIV RNA or HIV DNA test, is required."
What are the symptoms of HIV infection?,"Symptoms of the initial HIV infection can mimic those of influenza and other viral infections. The only reliable way to tell if you are infected is to get tested. Many people with HIV do not experience symptoms for years after the initial infection or have symptoms that are very similar to symptoms of other illnesses. For more, see this CDC web page: About HIV."
Why does my doctor want me to go to the same laboratory each time I have my HIV viral load tested?,"Laboratories may use different methods to measure HIV viral load, so results can vary from lab to lab. When you have a series of viral load tests done, it is advised that you have the tests done by the same method, typically by the same laboratory, so that the results can be compared and interpreted correctly. Tracking increases or decreases of your viral load must be done by the same method to provide an accurate picture of whether the virus is replicating or staying stable with the current therapy."
"Will exercise, nutrition, and other lifestyle modifications help decrease my HIV viral load?","There is no direct link between HIV viral load and exercise, nutrition, or other lifestyle factors. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does suggest that if you eat healthy foods, you will stay strong and keep up your energy. More information about this is contained in the CDC brochure Living with HIV."
"If I have undetectable HIV viral load, can I still spread the disease?","Yes. Although having an undetectable viral load will decrease the chances of you spreading the disease to others, it can still happen. An undetectable viral load only means that there are too few copies of the virus present in the blood to be detected by the test. The virus can still be present in body fluids, such as semen and vaginal fluids, so you can still spread the virus if you have unprotected sex."
Can an HIV RNA test be used to screen for HIV?,"The recommended test for HIV screening is a combination test that detects HIV antibody and HIV antigen. By detecting both antibody and antigen, the combination test increases the likelihood that an infection is detected soon after exposure. Most HIV screening tests detect only HIV antibody but are good options for screening because they may be available as rapid tests and at the point of care. If any of these screening tests are positive, they must be followed by another different antibody test. If the second test is positive, then HIV diagnosis is confirmed. If, however, the first and second result do not match, then an HIV RNA test may be done to help establish a diagnosis.
The recommended screening test for newborns, however, is an HIV RNA test (see next question)."
Why is the HIV RNA test used to test newborns for HIV infection?,"Babies born to mothers infected with HIV are typically tested soon after birth (usually within one to four months) to help determine whether the mother has passed the infection to her baby. An HIV RNA test is performed in babies instead of standard screening HIV antibody tests because antibodies to HIV produced by the mother can cross the placenta and enter the baby's blood. If an HIV antibody test were to be performed on a baby, the result could be positive even though the baby is not infected with the virus.
An infant with a positive HIV RNA test is likely infected with the virus. Repeat testing done on a second blood specimen is done to confirm the diagnosis. A negative HIV RNA test means that the baby is not infected (or may have been tested too soon after birth). If negative, the test is usually repeated when the infant is older than 1 month and again when the baby is older than 4 months. This may be necessary as the amount of virus may not be at a detectable level."
What causes the autoimmune disorders associated with HLA-B27?,"In most cases, the cause is not known. However, in some cases of reactive arthritis, there is an association between a previous infection by a microbe, such as Chlamydia, Campylobacter, Salmonella, Ureaplasma, or Yersinia, and the onset of the disease. It is thought that similarities between the HLA-B27 antigen and the antigens found on the surface of the microbes trigger the immune system to fight both the microbe and the person's own tissues, launching the autoimmune disorder after the resolution of the infection."
How long will it take for HLA-B27 results?,"That depends on the laboratory performing the testing. HLA-B27 testing requires specialized equipment and expertise to perform. It is not offered by every laboratory. In most cases, your blood sample will be sent to a reference laboratory and may take a few days for results to be available."
Should everyone have an HLA-B27 test done?,"Routine testing of the general public is not recommended. Usually only those with symptoms will be tested. A positive HLA-B27 in a person who does not have symptoms or a family history of HLA-B27-associated disease is not clinically significant. It does not help predict the likelihood of developing an autoimmune disease. Occasionally, a family member of a person who is positive for HLA-B27 and has an autoimmune disorder may be tested, but the test result cannot be used to predict whether the tested person will develop a related autoimmune disease."
"Other than organ and tissue compatibility testing, what else is HLA gene and antigen testing used for?","Historically, HLA testing was used to help identify someone (forensic testing) or to determine if people were related (parentage testing), although now there are other, more specific genetic tests available for these purposes. Other uses include disease-association testing and drug hypersensitivity testing. (See next question)"
What are the reasons to test for a specific HLA gene allele?,"Some HLA gene alleles are associated with certain diseases and autoimmune disorders. They are not diagnostic of the disorders but can be useful in helping to confirm or exclude a diagnosis. Relationships have also been documented between certain alleles and sensitivities to specific drugs. Genetic factors can change the way a therapeutic dose of medication behaves in one individual as compared to others. Currently, HLA antigen typing can sometimes be used to select the optimal medication, while reducing drug reactions and increasing the effectiveness of the treatment.
Some examples of these associations include:



Gene/Antigen
Disorders and Associations


HLA-B27
Ankylosing spondylitis, Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, Reactive arthritis


HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8
Celiac disease


HLA-DQB*06:02
Narcolepsy


HLA-B*57:01
Abacavir hypersensitivity


HLA-B*15:02
Carbamazepine hypersensitivity



 "
Is my blood type (ABO) related to my HLA genes and antigens?,"No. Although both systems are inherited and are important for tissue compatibility, they are independent of each other. The ABO system is located on chromosome 9 and the HLA system is on chromosome 6."
My newborn had a homocysteine test done. Why?,"A rare inherited condition called homocystinuria can greatly increase homocysteine in the blood and urine. Tests for both a urine and blood homocysteine may be used to help diagnose homocystinuria if a healthcare practitioner suspects that an infant or child may have this inherited disorder. In the U.S., all babies are routinely tested for excess methionine, a sign of homocystinuria caused by CBS dysfunction, as part of their newborn screening. If a baby's screening test is positive, then urine and blood homocysteine tests are often performed. Greatly increased concentrations of homocysteine in the urine and blood mean that it is likely that an infant has homocystinuria and indicates the need for further testing to confirm the cause of the increase.
In homocystinuria, one of several different genes—most commonly the CBS (cystathionine beta synthase) gene—is altered, disrupting the function of CBS. CBS is an enzyme that acts in a biochemical pathway and is responsible for converting homocysteine to a molecule called cysteine. As a result of CBS dysfunction, methionine (an amino acid), homocysteine and other toxic byproduct substances build up in the body. Some of the excess homocysteine is excreted in urine (homocystinuria).
The buildup of homocysteine and other byproduct substances in the body leads to multi-systemic disorder. Babies with this condition will appear normal at birth but, if not treated, they will, within a few years, begin to develop signs such as a dislocated lens in the eye, a long slender build, long thin fingers, skeletal abnormalities, osteoporosis, and a greatly increased risk of thromboembolism and of atherosclerosis that can lead to premature cardiovascular disease.
The buildup can also cause intellectual disability, mental illness, slightly low IQ, behavioral disorders, and seizures. Some of those may be alleviated if the condition is detected early, which is why all states screen newborns for homocystinuria."
What are some good sources of folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12?,"Cereal grains are the main source of folic acid, the synthetic version of folate, or vitamin B9. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration requires the addition of folic acid to grain products in this country. Good sources of vitamin B6 include fortified cereals, beans, poultry and fish, as well as some fruits and vegetables, including dark leafy greens, oranges, papayas and cantaloupe. Vitamin B12 can be found in red meats, poultry, fish, and other seafood, as it is only naturally found in animal products. However, it can also be consumed via fortified breakfast cereals or enriched nondairy milk such as soy or rice milk."
Could any medications I may be taking have an effect on my homocysteine level?,"Yes. There are numerous drugs that may either increase or decrease the amount of homocysteine in your body. You should always keep your healthcare provider and pharmacist aware of any medications, traditional or herbal, that you are taking since they may affect the test results. Carbamazepine, methotrexate, nitrous oxide, and phenytoin can all cause increased levels of homocysteine. Azaribine also raises homocysteine levels, though it was prohibited by the FDA in 1976. Colestipol and niacin, both lipid-lowering agents, can also increase homocysteine levels. Oral contraceptives can also affect the metabolism of homocysteine."
Can this test be performed at my healthcare practitioner’s office?,"No, HE4 testing requires specialized equipment. It is not widely available at this time and your sample may need to be sent to a reference laboratory."
Is it necessary to use both HE4 and CA-125?,"At this time, with available data, HE4 is not intended to be used by itself – it is considered an aid in the monitoring of epithelial ovarian cancer. Its use may evolve over time as more data become available."
Why would my healthcare provider not monitor my ovarian cancer with HE4?,"This test would not be indicated if you have a non-epithelial ovarian cancer. It would not be useful as a monitoring tool if your cancer does not produce increased amounts of HE4. Also, since it is a new test, your healthcare practitioner may be waiting for more data on the test to become available before adopting it."
Are men screened for HPV infection?,"Men are not routinely screened for HPV infection unless they fall into a category at high risk for cancer, such as those with compromised immune systems or men who have sex with men. Currently, there are no molecular tests approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to detect HPV in men. However, some specialty labs have validated molecular HPV tests for analyzing anal swabs from men. Additionally, men at high risk may be tested using a Pap test in which cells from the anus are examined under a microscope for abnormalities. As in cervical samples, positive results need to be followed up by the healthcare practitioner with further testing, including a more thorough exam and possible biopsy."
I'm a woman who has had the HPV vaccine. Do I need cervical cancer screening?,"Yes. Because currently available HPV vaccines do not protect against all cervical cancers, women who have been vaccinated still need routine screening."
"Besides HPV, what are other risk factors for cervical cancer in women?","According to the National Cancer Institute, certain factors can further increase your risk of developing cervical cancer after you have become infected with HPV. These include having multiple (3 or more) full-term pregnancies, long-term oral contraceptive (birth control pill) use, and cigarette smoking.
Increased risk for cervical cancer is also associated with:

Having a compromised immune system (e.g., HIV infection, after an organ transplant)
Being overweight
A diet lacking in fruits and vegetables
A history of exposure to DES (a drug given to some women between 1940 and 1971 to prevent miscarriage) before birth
A family history of cervical cancer
A history of chlamydia infection"
Should everyone be tested for HTLV-I/II?,"No. The incidence of HTLV-I/ll is low in the United States and most people who are infected do not ever become ill, so it is not considered necessary. However, since the viruses can be passed from one person to another through blood transfusions and organ transplants, all donated blood (since 1988) and all relevant donated organs are tested for HTLV-I/II."
Should I be tested for HTLV-I/II if I have some of the risk factors?,"This would be something to discuss with your healthcare practitioner. If you have risk factors, such as you have lived in one of the countries where these infections are more common, have had multiple sex partners, have been an IV drug user, or are a Native American Indian, then you and your healthcare practitioner may want to consider it."
I found out I am positive for HTLV. What precautions should I take to avoid infecting others?,"You can take several steps to avoid spreading the infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:

Tell your healthcare practitioner that you have been infected; he or she can speak with you about necessary precautions.
Do not donate blood, tissues, organs, or sperm.
If you are a new mother, do not breastfeed.
Do not share needles or syringes.
Use condoms to prevent sexual transmission."
Can I get HTLV-I/II from donating blood?,"No, blood collection is performed using a sterile needle. You cannot get an HTLV infection from donating."
The names HTLV and HIV look and sound similar – are these diseases related?,"They both belong to the same group of viruses known as retroviruses and can be passed through blood and sexual contact, but they are only very remotely related, and HTLV does NOT cause AIDS and does not have the same devastating effects on a person's immune system that HIV does.
HTLV and HIV do, however, share a historical naming convention. HTLV-III was the name given to HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) when it was first identified. The virus was later reclassified and the name was changed to HIV. Since that time, the term HTLV-III has been re-used to designate a different HTLV virus. The newly designated HTLV-III virus, as well as an HTLV-IV virus, have been identified and are being studied, but testing of them is only being done on a research basis."
Should I get a tuberculosis screening test if I am pregnant?,"You may be tested under your healthcare practitioner's supervision if there is a need to do so. Since TB can be passed from mother to child during pregnancy, if you are at an increased risk of contracting TB, your healthcare practitioner may want you to have TB screening done. Both the IGRA and TST are considered safe during pregnancy."
My newborn had an immunoglobulin test. Why?,"Sometimes an IgM test is used to determine whether a newborn acquired an infection before birth (congenital). IgM may be produced by a developing baby (fetus) in response to infection. Due to the size of IgM antibodies, they cannot pass through the placenta from mother to baby during pregnancy. Thus, any IgM antibodies present in a newborn's blood are not from the mother but were produced by the baby. This indicates that an infection began during pregnancy."
Is there something I can do to alter my immunoglobulin levels?,"In most cases, immunoglobulins do not respond to lifestyle changes. If you are taking a drug that is decreasing one or more of your immunoglobulins, then you and your healthcare practitioner may decide to alter your medications. It is very important, however, NOT to discontinue or change your medication dosage without consulting with your healthcare provider.
Infants gradually lose protection from infections as the levels of IgG they receive through the placenta from their mothers decrease after birth. Greater protection can be provided for babies through breastfeeding since breast milk contains IgA, which protects against infections."
Are there symptoms associated with decreased immunoglobulins?,"Not specific ones. Unexplained recurrent infections, multiple infections, or opportunistic infections, with or without chronic diarrhea, may indicate a need to check a person's immune status. A positive family history of an immunodeficiency may also require follow up. A thorough physical examination and a careful medical history can be critical to a diagnosis."
"In addition to the blood sample for this test, I was instructed to collect a urine sample. Why?","You may have been directed to give a urine sample to check for the presence of protein in your urine and/or to determine the amount and type of protein present in your urine. Your healthcare practitioner may suspect that, based on your medical history, signs and symptoms and/or other test results, you have a condition associated with abnormal or excessive immunoglobulin production. In such cases, a quantitative immunoglobulin test is often performed along with tests such as serum and urine protein electrophoresis to help establish a diagnosis."
"Is there a reason to choose one type of sample (blood, bone marrow, or tissue) over another for testing?  ","The type of sample to be tested is up to your healthcare practitioner and must be representative of your cancer. If abnormal cells are present in the bloodstream, a blood sample is often used for flow cytometry immunophenotyping as it is easy to obtain and less invasive than other collection methods. However, lymphoma cells may or may not find their way to the bloodstream and might require other collection techniques."
Can flow cytometry immunophenotyping be done at my local laboratory?,"It depends. It is not offered in every laboratory, but many larger hospitals and academic medical centers perform the testing or your sample may be sent to a reference laboratory."
Can results of testing be used to determine the course of my cancer?,"Diagnosis of leukemia or lymphoma is based on the visual examination of a blood smear and/or bone marrow biopsy and aspiration for the presence of certain cell types. Depending upon flow cytometry immunophenotyping results, a healthcare practitioner may determine how likely your cancer will respond to treatment and how aggressive the treatment might be. The course of treatment for your cancer will be determined by your healthcare practitioner and their team based on flow cytometry immunophenotyping and other tests that might be performed."
Will my WBC antigens change?,"It depends. The antigens on specific leukemia or lymphoma cells may remain the same over time. However, treatment with chemotherapy may eliminate the abnormal cells, and if treatment is successful, normal white blood cells (WBCs) will replace abnormal cells. Because of this, immunophenotyping results will be different by reflecting the current population of WBCs that would be present in an individual in remission. Sometimes, however, the cancer cells adapt to evade the therapy by not expressing anymore an antigen that they expressed earlier, which might have been targeted by a monoclonal antibody or other therapy, like CAR T-cells."
Are any other methods used for immunophenotyping?,"Originally, glass slides with fixed tissue sections were treated with an antibody that was specific for a type of antigen typically found on certain abnormal cells associated with a particular leukemia or lymphoma. These antibodies were often linked with a fluorescent or a chemical indicator that would make these abnormal cells visible when observed under a microscope. This approach, called immunohistochemistry, is used every day for some leukemia and lymphoma markers and other types of cancer. It may be because the markers of interest are not available for flow cytometry or because fresh cells or tissue are not available (a requirement for flow cytometry immunophenotyping)."
What other tests might my healthcare practitioner do to check pancreas function?,"Your healthcare practitioner may order a stool test for fecal fat, fecal elastase, or chymotrypsin or a blood test for amylase or lipase to look at other aspects of pancreas and digestive function."
Can I test negative and still have the flu?,"Yes. Influenza tests may not detect every case of the flu. Rapid antigen tests generally detect 50-70% of influenza cases, while molecular tests detect 66%-100% of cases, depending on the test used. A negative result may mean that the test is not detecting the influenza strain or that there is not sufficient virus in the sample to allow it to be detected. Also, new strains of influenza may be present in the sample that tests cannot reliably detect."
What other tests might my doctor order to diagnose my flu-like symptoms?,"Your healthcare provider may order a strep test to check for strep throat, an RSV test to check for respiratory syncytial virus, a virus that often infects young children and the elderly, or a sputum culture to look for bacterial and/or fungal causes of a respiratory infection. Your healthcare practitioner may also order blood tests such as a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) or complete blood count (CBC) to monitor the health and function of organs such as your lungs and kidneys."
Why is the flu such a big deal?,"The flu is an important general and public health concern because it can be deadly and because every few decades an especially lethal influenza strain emerges. The worst on record is the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, which killed 20 to 50 million people worldwide, and more than 500,000 in the United States alone. In 1957 and 1968, hundreds of thousands died in the U.S. from Asian and Hong Kong flu variants.
In more recent years, there has been international concern about the H5N1 and H7N9 subtypes of influenza A, commonly called avian (bird) flu, and H1N1 (swine) flu. Some of these subtypes have caused outbreaks in humans, and there is concern that they may in the future cause more widespread and serious outbreaks. Read the article on Influenza to learn more about these."
Should I get a flu shot?,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months old and older get a flu shot each season. In particular, people who are at high risk of complications from the flu should receive the vaccine. These include young children, the elderly, residents of nursing home and other long-term care facilities, pregnant women, and people with pre-existing conditions such as asthma, COPD, heart disease, and liver or kidney disorders."
Can I still get the flu if I've had the vaccine?,"Yes, it is possible to get the flu after being vaccinated since no vaccine is 100% effective. However, if you get the flu after being vaccinated, it is usually a milder illness with a quicker recovery. It also takes a few weeks after vaccination before antibodies are made to the vaccine that can provide protection. Occasionally, a new strain circulates that is not in the current vaccine, so you would not be protected against infection with that strain of the virus."
How do they decide what strains are in the vaccine each year?,"Each year, the flu vaccine, containing inactivated virus, is targeted to protect against the expected strains, based on the observations and experience of healthcare practitioners and scientists. Healthcare providers and researchers carefully track the influenza virus circulating worldwide and try to anticipate the strain(s) that will eventually appear locally the next season.
As influenza travels through communities around the world, it undergoes spontaneous changes (called ""antigenic drift"") that allow it to evade the protective antibodies formed from previous infections and vaccinations. The amount of ""antigenic drift"" varies from year to year. Bigger antigenic drifts, known as ""antigenic shifts,"" result in more severe illnesses since more people will be susceptible to the virus.
Sometimes the flu strain will have significant antigenic drift during the season so that the virus will appear slightly different to the body's immune system, decreasing the effectiveness of the vaccine's protection. Or, the flu that predominates may end up being an unexpected strain, not the ones that the vaccine was developed to protect against.
Usually, in these cases, the vaccination will at least lessen the severity of the infection. In individual high-risk patients (those with heart, kidney, and lung ailments, for instance), healthcare practitioners may bolster the protection by prescribing antiviral treatments before the person gets sick to provide short-term protection while influenza moves through the community."
Can I do an insulin test at home?,"No. Although glucose levels can be monitored at home, insulin tests require specialized instruments and training and are performed at laboratories."
Why does insulin have to be injected?,"Insulin must be injected or given via an insulin pump. It cannot be given orally because it is a protein and is broken down in the stomach before it can be absorbed. In February 2015, a short-acting inhalable insulin became available."
What signs and symptoms are seen with deficient GH and IGF-1?,"In children, the following may indicate GH and/or IGF-1 deficiency:

Slowed growth rate in early childhood relative to group norms
Shorter stature, arm and leg lengths, and lower weight than other children of the same age
Delayed puberty
X-rays showing delayed bone development
Thin hair
Poor nail growth
Delayed closure of the sutures of the skull

In adults, abnormally low levels of GH and/or IGF-1 may cause subtle, nonspecific symptoms such as:

Decreased bone density
Fatigue
Adverse lipid changes
Reduced exercise tolerance
Depression
Thinning, dry skin"
What signs and symptoms are seen with excess GH and IGF-1 production?,"In a child, the main sign is unusually tall stature. Other signs and symptoms of gigantism in children include:

Mild to moderate obesity
Overly large head
Exaggerated growth of hands and feet

With an adult, it may be more subtle: a larger nose, thicker lips, a more prominent jaw, or thickening of fingers (rings and shoes that no longer fit). Other signs and symptoms may include:

Deepened, husky voice
Enlarged organs (liver, heart, kidneys, spleen, thyroid/parathyroid glands, pancreas)
Enlarged tongue
Erectile dysfunction
Fatigue
Headaches and visual disturbances
Joint pain and swelling
Menstrual cycle irregularities
Muscle weakness
Snoring
Increased size/function of sebaceous and sweat glands, resulting in excessive sweating and body odor
Thickening of the skin, skin tags, increased coarse body hair
Peripheral neuropathy (e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome)"
Can this test be done in my doctor's office?,"No. In fact, this test is not available in every laboratory. Your blood may be sent to a reference laboratory."
How long do I have to be monitored?,"As long as you are considered to have abnormal (low or high) GH production or are receiving GH replacement therapy, your IGF-1 will need to be monitored. However, IGF-1 is not routinely measured to monitor GH treatment of GH-deficient children. The best way to determine whether GH treatment is working in children who are GH-deficient is noting that they are growing faster and taller."
Can IL-6 be measured in samples other than blood?,"Interleukin-6 may sometimes be measured in other body fluids, such as joint fluid (synovial fluid) and cerebrospinal fluid."
Can I lower my IL-6 level?,Concentrations of IL-6 will decrease with a decrease in inflammation but there is not currently evidence that IL-6 levels respond to lifestyle changes.
Should everyone have an intrinsic factor antibody test?,It is not intended as a general screening test. It is only performed to help determine the cause of a demonstrated vitamin B12 deficiency.
Can I have an intrinsic factor antibody test done at my doctor's office?,"This test requires specialized equipment and is not offered by every laboratory. In most cases, your blood sample will need to be sent to a reference laboratory."
Can I get rid of intrinsic factor antibodies?,"No, they are produced by your immune system and do not respond to lifestyle changes. The associated vitamin B12 deficiency, however, can usually be successfully treated and managed by vitamin B12 supplementation."
Do all people with iron deficiency have anemia?,"Iron deficiency refers to a decrease in the amount of iron stored in the body, while iron deficiency anemia refers to a drop in the number of red blood cells (RBCs), hemoglobin and hematocrit caused by not having enough stored iron (there are many other causes of anemia). It typically takes several weeks after iron stores are depleted for the hemoglobin level to decrease and production of RBCs to be affected and for anemia to develop. There usually are few symptoms seen in the early stages of iron deficiency, but as the condition worsens and blood levels of hemoglobin and RBCs decrease, ongoing weakness, pallor, and fatigue can eventually develop.
As your iron continues to be depleted, you may have shortness of breath and dizziness. If the anemia is severe, chest pain, headaches, and leg pains may occur. Children may develop learning (cognitive) disabilities. Besides the general symptoms of anemia, there are certain symptoms that are characteristic of iron deficiency. These include dysphagia, pica (cravings for specific substances, such as ice, corn starch, licorice, chalk, dirt, or clay), a burning sensation in the tongue or a smooth tongue, sores at the corners of the mouth, and spoon-shaped fingernails and toenails."
What foods can I eat to increase the iron in my diet?,"The form of iron that is easiest for the body to absorb is found in meats and eggs. Other iron-rich sources include: green leafy vegetables (such as spinach, collard greens, and kale), wheat germ, whole grain breads and cereals, raisins, and molasses."
Who needs iron supplements?,"The people who typically need iron supplements are pregnant women and those with documented iron deficiency. People should not take iron supplements before talking to their healthcare practitioner as excess iron can cause chronic iron overload. An overdose of iron pills can be toxic, especially to children."
Does anemia due to iron deficiency happen quickly or does it take a long time?,"Iron deficiency anemia comes on gradually. When your rate of iron loss exceeds the amount of iron you absorb from the foods you eat or supplements, iron stores are slowly used up. At this stage, ferritin will be low, but serum iron and TIBC are usually normal and there is no anemia. As the iron deficiency worsens, serum iron levels fall, TIBC and transferrin rise, and anemia starts to develop. With prolonged or severe iron deficiency, the red cells become small and pale due to decreased hemoglobin levels. Reticulocyte count also decreases."
Does donating blood affect my iron level?,"Yes. Every time you donate a pint of blood, your body loses some iron. The level of ferritin, which is a reflection of the total amount of storage iron in the body, drops with each donation and then returns to normal over time. Other tests, such as serum iron and TIBC, are not as affected by blood donation."
My doctor instructed me to take my iron supplement and then have an iron test done.  Why would that be?,"Your doctor may suspect that you are not absorbing the iron you need from your supplements and your diet, so may ask that you have your iron level checked shortly after you take your iron supplement. If you take iron and then have an abnormally low test result, you may have an underlying condition affecting the absorption of iron. You may need to be treated for the condition causing the malabsorption for your iron levels to return to normal."
Do all people with iron deficiency have anemia? What are the symptoms?,"Iron deficiency refers to a decrease in the amount of iron stored in the body, while iron deficiency anemia refers to a drop in the number of red blood cells (RBCs), hemoglobin and hematocrit caused by not having enough stored iron (there are many other causes of anemia). It typically takes several weeks after iron stores are depleted for the level of hemoglobin and production of RBCs to be affected and for anemia to develop. There usually are few symptoms early in iron deficiency, but as the condition worsens and blood levels of hemoglobin and RBCs decrease, then ongoing weakness and fatigue can eventually develop.
As your iron continues to be depleted, you may have shortness of breath and dizziness. If the anemia is severe, chest pain, headaches, and leg pains may occur. Children may develop learning (cognitive) disabilities. Besides the general symptoms of anemia, there are certain symptoms that are characteristic of iron deficiency. These include dysphagia, pica (cravings for specific substances, such as ice, corn starch, licorice, chalk, dirt, or clay), a burning sensation in the tongue or a smooth tongue, sores at the corners of the mouth, and spoon-shaped fingernails and toenails."
What are some other tests that might be done to detect iron deficiency or iron overload?,"Several other tests can also be used to help recognize problems with iron status.

Hemoglobin and hematocrit are tests that are performed as part of a complete blood count (CBC). A low value for either test indicates that a person has anemia. Iron deficiency is a very common cause of anemia. The average size of red cells (Mean Corpuscular Volume or MCV) and the average amount of hemoglobin in red cells (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin or MCH) are also measured in a CBC. In iron deficiency, insufficient hemoglobin is made, causing the red blood cells to be smaller than normal. Both MCV and MCH are low. In addition, the hemoglobin concentration in red cells (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration or MCHC) is decreased; the red cells in iron deficiency anemia look much paler than normal ones.
Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR). This test may be used to detect iron deficiency anemia and distinguish it from anemia caused by chronic illness or inflammation. In patients with iron deficiency, the sTfR level is elevated.
Zinc Protoporphyrin (ZPP). The amount of zinc protoporphyrin in red cells is increased in iron deficiency. ZPP is sometimes used as a screening test in children and teens. However, the test is not specific for iron deficiency; thus, elevated values must be confirmed by other tests.
HFE gene test. Hemochromatosis is a genetic disease, found primarily in Caucasians, that causes the body to absorb too much iron. It is usually due to an inherited mutation in the HFE gene that affects the amount of iron absorbed from the digestive tract. The HFE gene test determines whether a person has the mutations that cause the disease. Read the article on Hemochromatosis to learn more."
What are some causes of anemia besides iron deficiency?,"There are many different conditions that can cause anemia other than iron deficiency. Some examples include vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiencies, cancer (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome), chronic infection or inflammation, and genetic disorders such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia. However, iron deficiency is a very common cause, which is why iron tests are so frequently performed. If iron tests rule out iron deficiency, another source for the anemia must be found. Read the article on Anemia to learn more."
What foods contain the most iron?,"Heme iron is the easiest form of iron for the body to absorb. It is found in meats and eggs. Non-heme iron is found in a wide variety of plants and in iron supplements. Iron-rich sources include green leafy vegetables such as spinach, collard greens, and kale, wheat germ, whole grain breads and cereals, raisins, and molasses. If you have been diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia or you are pregnant or breast feeding, vitamin pills or tablets may be needed to provide extra iron. Ask your healthcare practitioner about the right supplement for you."
Who needs iron supplements?,"The people who typically need iron supplements are pregnant women and those with documented iron deficiency. People should not take iron supplements before talking to their healthcare practitioner as excess iron can cause chronic iron overload. An overdose of iron pills can be toxic, especially to children."
Who needs iron supplements?,"No. Type 1 diabetes as well as other types of diabetes are screened for, diagnosed, and monitored using tests for blood glucose and/or A1c. The autoantibody tests can be used after diabetes is already diagnosed to help differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes."
"Do the autoantibodies ICA, IAA, GADA, IA-2A or ZnT8A destroy the beta cells?","They are associated with beta cell destruction and reflect an ongoing autoimmune process, but they are not thought to cause the damage."
Can this test be done in my healthcare practitioner's office?,JAK2 mutation testing must be done in a laboratory that performs molecular testing. It is not offered by every laboratory and must often be sent out to a reference laboratory.
How long does it take for JAK2 mutation test results?,"It depends on the laboratory that is performing the test. Generally, results may be available within a few weeks."
Is there any reason to repeat a JAK2 mutation test?,"A healthcare practitioner may repeat this test if it was negative and the healthcare practitioner feels that the mutation may have been missed. One reason it might be negative is that the proportion of your cells that have the JAK2 V617F mutation may be low. Currently, the test is not nationally standardized, so the sensitivity of the test may vary somewhat from laboratory to laboratory. A second test done at a later time and/or sent to a different laboratory may detect the JAK2 V617F mutation if it is present.
Also, some healthcare practitioners may order a quantitative test periodically to monitor the change in the number of cells with the JAK2 V617F mutation over time. Results from repeated quantitative tests may be useful in monitoring the effectiveness of treatment if ongoing research shows that the JAK2 gene is an appropriate target for MPN therapies."
Are there other genetic mutations associated with MPNs?,"Yes, calreticulin (CALR) gene mutations (exon 9) are found in 20-25% of adult patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and 25-30% of adult patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF). In addition, mutations in the myeloproliferative leukemia (MPL) gene are seen in 2-5% of adult ET patients and 3-5% of adult PMF patients, but not with polycythemia vera (PV). PV, ET and PMF are all rare in children and adolescents and although mutations might not be as common as in adults with these same diseases, not much is known. Genetic testing is also sometimes used to check for the presence or absence of a Philadelphia (Ph') chromosome or a BCR-ABL1 translocation in a person suspected of having chronic myeloid leukemia."
How large are kidney stones?,"Kidney stones may be as small as a grain of sand, as large as a golf ball, or even larger, with some filling up the entire collecting system of the kidney. These are sometimes called ""staghorn"" stones (calculi) because the shape of the collecting system resembles the antlers of a deer. They can cause problems either because they grow large enough to obstruct urine flow or because they become dislodged or break off and begin to travel from a kidney through the ureter, where they can cause temporary obstruction and stretch, irritate, and/or damage the walls of the ureter. This movement can cause abrupt, extremely severe pain that may be intermittent or continuous.
Many stones will eventually pass out of the body in the urine, but some are too large or have too irregular a shape for the body to expel. With very large stones, which typically cannot pass from the kidney into the ureters, and for smaller stones that get into but do not pass through the ureters, some form of treatment is needed."
"If I have had a kidney stone, what foods or drinks should I avoid ?  ","You should work with your healthcare provider to determine the best treatment for you as it may depend on the type of stone. If you had a stone, reducing salt and overly-salted foods are recommended (a total of <2,300 mg/day). If eating oxalate-rich foods, an adequate amount of calcium should accompany the meal. Limiting the intake of foods high in purine, such as red meat, organ meat, and shellfish, and increasing fruit and vegetable consumption may minimize the risk of stone formation."
Do I really need to save all of my urine for 24 hours?,"Yes, your healthcare provider needs to know how much urine you are producing over a 24-hour period (volume) and how much of each of the substances is present. Since the substances may be eliminated in the urine at varying rates, the 24-hour urine is a better representation than a single or random urine sample and is a consistent frame of reference."
Is it necessary to do both blood and urine tests?,That will depend on the information that your healthcare provider wants to evaluate. It is common to compare some substances in both the blood and the urine.
Can stones form in other parts of the urinary tract besides the kidney?,"Yes. For example, stones can form in the bladder; however, the reason for and the mechanism by which they form are different than for kidney stones. Instead of causes related to excreting excess amounts of a particular substance, bladder stones are typically caused by an inability to completely empty the bladder during urination. A bladder stone may be caused by some underlying urinary tract problem such as lack of bladder control, enlarged prostate, or urinary tract infection."
"In addition to stone testing, what other lab tests might be done?","Blood, urine, and 24-hour urine tests are often ordered to determine whether you produce excess chemicals that may contribute to the formation of kidney stones and to evaluate your overall health. The test results can help distinguish between a probable stone and other conditions that may have similar symptoms but require different treatment. Testing may include:

Blood and 24-hour urine tests for calcium, uric acid, creatinine, and sometimes oxalate, citrate, phosphate, and/or cystine
Urinalysis - to detect red and white blood cells, crystals, signs of infection, and to measure urine pH
Complete blood count (CBC) - to evaluate white blood cells for signs of infection"
Do I really have to filter all of my urine for this test?,"Yes, as long as you have a suspected stone and are instructed to do so by your healthcare provider. Since it is impossible to determine when the stone will pass, it is important to screen all of the urine in order to find and send it for analysis."
Can I just test my blood or urine instead of the stone?,"Blood and urine can provide important information about your condition, but they will not indicate exactly which chemical compounds constitute the stone. The more information your healthcare practitioner has, the better the chance that he or she can help you prevent stone recurrence."
How bad is the pain with kidney stones?,"It depends upon the stone and will vary from person to person, but it is often severe and sometimes must be treated with strong prescription pain medications. For most people, the pain is most intense when the stone is moving through the urinary tract."
"If I have had a kidney stone, should I avoid calcium?  ","You should work with your healthcare provider to determine the best treatment for you. If you had a stone with calcium in it, your healthcare practitioner may have you decrease your intake a modest amount, but the clinical picture is often less black and white than taking more or less. Some people absorb extra calcium from their food, but some excess calcium in the urine is related to an excess of sodium, so people who have had calcium-containing stones are often told to decrease salt intake rather than reducing calcium intake. Taking large doses of supplemental calcium may play a role in kidney stone formation. Sometimes drastic reductions in calcium can worsen stone formation as well as affect bone health."
How does a healthcare practitioner find a stone in my urinary tract?,The healthcare practitioner can use imaging tests to locate and evaluate a kidney stone. These tests can help determine whether a stone is likely to pass out of the body without medical intervention.
Who performs a kidney stone analysis?,"This testing requires specialized equipment and expertise. It is not offered by every laboratory. In most cases, your stone will be sent to a reference laboratory."
What are some of the specific methods used to analyze kidney stones?,Common methods of kidney stone analysis include infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffractometry. You can read more about these and other methods at the web site for the Louis C. Herring and Company Kidney Stone Analysis Laboratory. 
Should everyone with cancer have KRAS mutation testing?,Testing is not generally indicated unless a person has colon cancer or non-small cell lung cancer.
Would this testing and drug therapy be useful for other types of cancer?,"It is possible, since KRAS mutations are found in other cancers. This is a focus for medical researchers, but it may be some time before the usefulness of the testing and therapy in other cancers is determined. For example, whether KRAS mutations are associated with less efficient EGFR-targeted therapy in pancreatic cancer patients remains controversial and requires further investigation."
Is it necessary to repeat a KRAS mutation test?,"This is not usually necessary but might occur if your health practitioner thought that the first sample tested might have been insufficient. In some cases, a health care provider may order a KRAS test that detects a mutation in another part of the DNA or another more rare KRAS mutation. Sometimes metastatic tumors may be not be accessible or have limited tissue for testing. In these cases, a sample (if available) from your primary cancer may be obtained for testing. Frequently, if the primary tumor has a KRAS mutation, so will the metastatic tumor."
Can this test be performed by my local laboratory?,"It may be available in some larger laboratories, but must often it will be sent to a reference laboratory. Depending on the laboratory, it may take a few days or weeks for results to be available."
Can this test be performed on my blood instead?,"Some medical laboratories can perform KRAS mutation testing on tumor tissue as well as bone marrow and blood. However, the research that evaluated the role of KRAS mutations in treatment response was based solely on tumor testing. Therefore, the preferred sample for KRAS testing is tumor tissue."
Is there anything I can do to decrease my lactate level?,"Generally, no. However, if your elevated lactate level is due to an underlying condition that can be addressed, such as uncontrolled diabetes or a substance that can be avoided, such as ethanol, then you may be able to lower it. If you have been diagnosed with a condition, such as a metabolic disorder, following your prescribed treatment regimen should control your lactate level. If the increase is due to a temporary condition, such as shock or infection, then it will usually return to normal after the condition has been resolved."
Why would a healthcare practitioner choose to measure lactate in a blood sample from an artery rather than blood from a vein?,"Lactate measurements from arterial blood are thought to be more accurate and, because a tourniquet is not used, they are not generally affected by the collection process. A healthcare practitioner may order an arterial lactate for these reasons or because a sample for a group of other tests called arterial blood gases (ABGs) is being collected at the same time and the same sample can be used for all tests. When other arterial blood tests are not being ordered, a healthcare practitioner may order a venous lactate because it provides an adequate evaluation of a person's lactate level and because the collection process is not as uncomfortable."
Are there other ways to measure lactate than by sending a blood sample to the lab for testing?,"Yes. Lactate may be measured using a small hand-held device much like a glucose meter at the point of care (POC, at a patient's bedside) instead of in a laboratory. This type of monitoring is useful, for example, in emergency departments and intensive care units where rapid results are vital to the care of critically ill people. However, since the methods of measurement are different, the results from lactate POC tests may not be comparable with those from tests performed in a laboratory."
"If the LD test is not specific, how can it be clinically useful?","The LD test can be useful because it can alert a healthcare practitioner that cellular injury is occurring. In a similar fashion, tests such as a C-reactive protein (CRP) warn that inflammation is occurring somewhere in the body."
Is there anything I can do to lower my LD?,"No, it is an indicator of injury that will typically return to normal when the underlying condition resolves. If someone has a chronic condition with ongoing tissue damage, such as may occur with liver disease, then increased LD concentrations may persist."
Should both a lactoferrin and a calprotectin test be done?,Current evidence suggests that there is not a significant benefit to performing both tests as they both detect intestinal inflammation.
Does it matter whether I have a lactoferrin or a calprotectin test?,"Calprotectin has been more extensively studied and is ordered more frequently, but in general they are both thought to be useful tests."
What can I do to decrease my lactoferrin?,"Lactoferrin is a reflection of intestinal inflammation and is not affected by lifestyle changes. If it is due to an infection, then it will most likely return to normal when the infection resolves. If it is due to inflammatory bowel disease, then it will rise and fall with disease activity."
Should everyone have lactose tolerance testing?,"Many people have some degree of lactose intolerance, especially as they age, but general testing is not considered necessary."
Is the breath test used for other things?,"Yes, other sugar ""loads"" can be given to examine other sugar (disaccharide) intolerances; however, lactose is the most commonly tested.
Other breath tests are available to help detect conditions, but they measure different substances and are unrelated to tolerance testing. Two examples are a breath test for Helicobacter pylori infection and alcohol (ethanol) testing."
Can I do anything to increase my production of lactase?,"No, lactase concentrations do not change with lifestyle changes. However, many people with lactose intolerance are able to digest small amounts of milk and are often able to tolerate yogurt and hard cheeses."
Does lactose intolerance only apply to breast milk and cow's milk?,"No, lactose is present in the milk of all mammals, including, for example, goat's milk."
Does soy milk have lactose in it?,"No. Most people with lactose intolerance can drink soy milk as well as other plant-based products, such as rice milk or almond milk."
Can I test my LDL cholesterol at home?,"There are tests available to use at home to measure total cholesterol. You prick your finger and put blood on a piece of paper that will change color based on your cholesterol level (or use your blood and a small device to do the same thing).
There are also kits available that have you collect a blood sample at home and then mail it to a reference laboratory, which will perform a lipid panel and send the results back to you."
How can I decrease my LDL-P?,"LDL-P can be altered by adopting a reduced-calorie diet, losing excess weight, and exercising regularly. The use of lipid-lowering drugs such as statins and PCSK9-inhibitors will significantly reduce LDL-P."
"What products in the U.S. still contain lead, besides paint and ceramics?","Some products that still contain lead include car batteries, solder, some pipes, ammunition, roofing, industrial paints, job sites, hobby areas, electronics, batteries, scrap metal recycling, some PVC, vinyl and plastics, brass objects including keys, costume jewelry, and X-ray shield materials."
How do people get exposed? Is touching these products enough to raise my blood lead level?,"Just holding a lead object in your hands won’t poison you. Most lead is present as an inorganic compound and does not move well through the skin. Breathing in or swallowing lead-laden dust may poison you, however. Situations that could lead to lead poisoning would be:

Touching surfaces covered with lead dust and then transferring the dust to your mouth with fingers, food, or toys
A toddler touching the windowsills in a pre-1978 house with their mouth or fingers and then swallowing lead dust or lead chips
Inhaling dust during a home renovation project on a house built before 1978, especially when using power sanders or other work practices that generate lead-contaminated dust
Ingesting lead through gardening in contaminated soil around the foundation of an older house or garage, or in soil contaminated with leaded gas along older highways, or abandoned industrial settings
Drinking water through lead pipes – nearly 10 million Americans get drinking water from pipes that are partially lead. In addition, high levels of lead are found in drinking water throughout the U.S., most particularly in Flint, MI.
Swallowing lead shot (shotgun ammunition), a curtain weight, or a lead toy and not passing it through your system
Inhaling fumes from burning lead-painted wood or battery casings in home fireplaces
Consumer products: 
	
Baby bibs, electrical cords, purses, garden hoses
Toys, art supplies, imitation leather, jewelry, hair dyes
Brass faucets, fishery sinkers, curtain weights"
What occupations might result in lead exposure?,"Some occupations that put people and their families at risk for lead exposure include:

Lead smelting
Construction
Steel welding
Bridge reconstruction
Firing range instruction and cleaners
Remodeling and refinishing older homes
Foundry work
Scrap metal recycling
Stained glass making
Using lead glazes in ceramics
Painting metal
Auto repair work
Electrician work
Cable splicing"
Are there ways to protect myself and my family from lead exposure?,"Yes. If your home was built before 1978:

Assume that you may have lead in the house, or get the house and the soil that surrounds it checked by a professional
Use cold water for drinking
Damp mop smooth floors and surfaces frequently to control dust
Vacuum carpets and upholstery to remove dust – use a HEPA vacuum filter if possible
Do a monthly check to look for chipping, peeling, or other damaged surfaces, especially in window areas and porches; repair any chipping, peeling, or damaged paint or surface as soon as it is observed, then thoroughly clean the area to remove lead dust
Learn how to do renovation and repair projects using lead-safe work practices to avoid creating more lead dust or contamination

For your child:

Frequently wash your child’s hands and toys to reduce lead dust contamination
Avoid using home remedies that contain lead
Keep your children (and pregnant women) away from lead hazards and out of the area during renovation or repair projects
Don’t let children put objects in their mouths that were not made to be used as a child’s toy, including keys, jewelry, or dirt
Get your child tested for lead at least at 1 and 2 years of age; contact your local health department to learn more about screening recommendations for your area
Eat a well-balanced diet with adequate calcium, iron, and vitamin C"
Are there ways to protect myself and my family if I have a job where I may be exposed to lead?,"Yes. If you are working in a job with potential exposure to lead dust or fumes:

Wash your hands before you eat, drink, or smoke
Eat, drink, and smoke in areas that are free from lead dust and fumes
Wear a properly fitted respirator with a HEPA filter (N-100 rating); shave your face to get the best fit
Keep your street clothes in a clean place; change into different clothes and shoes before you work with lead
Shower immediately after working with lead, before you go home
Launder your work clothes at the work place or separately from other family members’ clothes"
Is there a blood test for Legionella?,"Blood tests for Legionella pneumophila antibody are no longer routinely performed but may be available from some reference laboratories. The test detects antibodies, the body's immune response to a legionella infection, in the blood. It is not useful for immediate clinical decision-making but can be ordered to confirm a recent infection. Usually two blood samples taken weeks apart are tested, and an increase in the level of antibodies against the bacteria indicates an active infection. A single positive antibody test cannot be used to diagnose a recent infection as up to 15% of the general population may have legionella antibodies in their blood, indicating exposure to the bacteria at some point in their life. Some people, such as those who have compromised immune systems, can have a legionella infection without having a normal antibody response."
"Besides tests for Legionella pneumophila, what other testing may be done?","Other tests may be performed to help evaluate a person's overall health status and to distinguish between conditions that cause similar symptoms. These may include:

Sputum culture
Gram stain
AFB testing
Complete blood count
Chemistry panel

Legionnaires disease can affect other blood test results. These tests are not used to help diagnose a legionella infection but may be additional clues for the healthcare provider and information about the person's health status. Often seen are:

Decreased sodium
Increased phosphate
Increased ESR and CRP
Increased liver enzymes

And also:

Blood and protein in the urine
On a Gram stain slide under the microscope, the presence of white blood cells but few or no bacteria. If Legionella bacteria are present, they typically appear as small, pale, Gram-negative (pink stained) variable-shaped rods."
Can water be tested for Legionella bacteria?,"Yes, and it frequently is tested to monitor complex water systems, to detect the source of legionellosis outbreaks, and to monitor the effectiveness of water treatment when Legionella bacteria are detected."
Should everyone with flu-like symptoms be tested for Legionella?,"Pontiac fever, the type of legionella infection that causes flu-like systems, is generally self-limiting and resolves in most cases without treatment, so testing is not considered routinely necessary. Testing might be warranted in cases where Legionnaires disease symptoms are associated with travel, hospitalization, a stay in an assisted-living facility, or other risk factors (e.g., smoking, older than age 50, chronic lung disease, etc)."
Why is it called Legionnaires disease?,The disease and bacteria were named after an incident in which a significant number of people who went to an American Legion convention in Philadelphia in 1976 developed pneumonia. A new type of bacteria was identified as the cause and was subsequently named Legionella. This outbreak caused illness in 182 people and resulted in 29 deaths.
What are the long-term consequences of pancreatitis?,"With acute pancreatitis, there is usually no long-term damage and often no further problems develop.  Chronic pancreatitis, which may present as a series of acute attacks, can cause permanent damage. As the pancreas becomes scarred, some people develop diabetes and/or the inability to digest foods, especially fats, leading to malnutrition. The lack of normal pancreatic enzymes may lead to adverse effects on food digestion and waste production, causing malabsorption, abdominal pain, greasy stools, and the formation of stones in the pancreas. Complications also include pancreatic cancer as well as osteoporosis. Even if the disease is controlled, the damage is often irreversible. If the disease progresses, it could lead to death."
Do elevated lipase levels always mean I have a pancreatic condition?,"In some cases, an elevated lipase level may be due to a condition other than pancreatitis. In pancreatitis, the lipase level rises quickly and drops in 8 to 14 days. In other conditions, the rise is usually not as great and the level may be maintained for a longer period. Moderately increased lipase values can occur in other conditions, such as kidney disease, and may also be due to decreased clearance from the blood, salivary gland inflammation, gallbladder inflammation, celiac disease, a bowel obstruction, or peptic ulcer disease. The lipase test is not, however, usually used to monitor these conditions. Your healthcare practitioner will determine whether you have a pancreatic disorder and will make a diagnosis based on your symptoms, medical history, and test results."
What does the test result mean (adults)?,"In general, healthy lipid levels help to maintain a healthy heart and lower the risk of heart attack or stroke. Your healthcare practitioner will take into consideration the results of each component of a lipid panel plus other risk factors to help determine your overall risk of coronary heart disease, whether treatment is necessary and, if so, which treatment will best help to lower your risk of heart disease.
Health organizations have different recommendations for treatment based on your predicted CVD risk.
Guidelines from the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) recommend that a risk calculator be used to determine your 10-year risk of CVD if you are age 40 to 75 and do not have heart disease. Many factors are considered in the calculation, including total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, age, gender, race, blood pressure, presence of diabetes, and smoking habit. An initial (baseline) risk should be calculated and then your risk can be tracked over time with each subsequent risk calculation. Ten-year risk is categorized below:



Calculated 10-Year Risk
Risk Category


Less than 5%
Low


5% to 7.4%
Borderline


7.5% to 19.9%
Intermediate


Greater than 20%
High



ACC and AHA recommend treatment with statins if you:

Have heart disease (diagnosed by medical history, physical exam, imaging scans, etc.)
Have LDL-C greater than 190 mg/dL (4.90 mmol/L)
Are age 40 to 75 years with diabetes and LDL-C 70-189 mg/dL (1.81-4.90 mmol/L) but do not have heart disease
Are age 40 to 75 years old and do not have diabetes or heart disease but have LDL-C level between 70-189 mg/dL (1.81-4.90 mmol/L) and 10-year risk of developing heart disease of greater than 7%

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) makes recommendations on the use of statins for treatment in adults ages 40 to 75 with no history of heart disease (i.e., no symptoms of coronary artery disease or stroke), based on risk factors (i.e., LDL-C greater than 130 mg/dL(3.37 mmol/L), HDL-C level less than 40 mg/dL(1.0 mmol/L), diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking) and the use of the risk calculator.

If you have one or more risk factors and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater, USPSTF recommends the use of a low-to-moderate dose statin.
If you have one or more risk factors and your calculated 10-year CVD event risk is 7.5% to 10%, then the Task Force says your healthcare practitioner may choose to offer a low-to-moderate dose statin. This is because the probability that you will have a CVD event is lower, so the benefit of statin is likely to be smaller.

In adults ages 21 to 39, there is not enough evidence on the effect of screening for unhealthy lipid levels, according to the USPSTF. Also, in adults 76 years or older with no history of CVD, current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of preventive statin use.
Use of the risk calculator and ACC/AHA guidelines remains controversial and is evolving as more data become available. Some say that the current risk calculator can overestimate risk. Many still use older guidelines (2002) from the NCEP Adult Treatment Panel III to evaluate lipid levels and CVD risk, as summarized in the table below:



Test

Men
Less than 40 mg/dL (1.0 mmol/L)
40-50 mg/dL (1.0-1.3 mmol/L)
60 mg/dL (1.55 mmol/L) or higher



According to NCEP Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, if you have LDL-C above the following target values and risk factors (e.g., family history, cigarette smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure), you require treatment.
The target LDL-C value is:

Less than 100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L) if you have heart disease or diabetes [and ideally less than 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L)]
Less than 130 mg/dL (3.37 mmol/L) if you have 2 or more risk factors
Less than 160 mg/dL (4.14 mmol/L) if you have 0 or 1 risk factor"
"What does the test result mean (children, teens and young adults)?","A full, fasting lipid panel is recommended for screening children and teens with risk factors for developing heart disease, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Fasting prior to lipid screening in children without risk factors is unnecessary. Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) is the recommended test for non-fasting lipid screening. Non-HDL-C-is calculated by testing for total cholesterol and HDL-C and taking the difference between the two levels. Recommended cut-off values include:

*Adapted from ""Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: Summary report."" Pediatrics 2011; 128."
What is the difference between primary CVD treatment and secondary treatment?,"Primary treatment is preventive. It is intended to help reduce your risk of having a first cardiovascular event (such as a heart attack or stroke). There are potential benefits – helping to prevent CVD from developing – but also potential risks/harms associated with taking statins or other lipid-lowering medications long-term. You and your healthcare practitioner need to weigh those benefits and risks.
Secondary treatment is therapy that is given when you have had a cardiovascular event or have been diagnosed with CVD. It will still likely involve statins (and/or other therapies) but is intended to help prevent another CVD event."
I had a screening test for cholesterol. It was less than 200 mg/dL (5.18 mmol/L). Do I need a lipid panel?,"If your total cholesterol is below 200 (5.18 mmol/L) and you have no family history of heart disease or other risk factors, a full lipid profile may not be necessary. However, an HDL cholesterol measurement would be advisable to assure that you do not have a low HDL-C."
Can I test my lipids at home?,"There are tests available to use at home to measure total cholesterol. You prick your finger and put blood on a piece of paper that will change color based on your cholesterol level (or use your blood and a small device to do the same thing).
There are also kits available that have you collect a blood sample at home and then mail it to a reference laboratory, which will then perform a lipid panel and send the results back to you."
Should everyone have an Lp(a) test done?,"Lp(a) is not a routinely ordered test. Guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association state that elevated levels of Lp(a) are associated with an increased risk of early heart disease and are genetically determined but do not recommend widespread screening. Other guidelines recommend testing for individuals with a strong family history of early heart disease and/or high lipid levels, or those with intermediate cardiovascular risk, but do not recommend general screening."
Why would my healthcare practitioner want me to wait to test my lipids?,"In general, lipids should not be measured during a fever or major infection, within four weeks of a heart attack, a stroke, or major surgery, right after excessive alcohol intake, with severely uncontrolled diabetes, when a woman is pregnant, or during rapid weight loss."
Why would my healthcare practitioner order an Lp(a) more than once?,"Typically, the Lp(a) level is only tested once because it is usually fairly constant. Occasionally, your healthcare practitioner may order a second Lp(a) to confirm the initial level, especially if it was measured when you were ill, or to see if a woman's risk has increased significantly after menopause."
Can I have an Lp(a) test done in my healthcare practitioner's office?,The Lp(a) test requires specialized equipment to perform and is usually performed in a reference laboratory. Your sample may be sent out for testing.
Is there any way to lower my Lp(a)?,"Lp(a) levels are genetically determined and difficult to change. Niacin and estrogen (for postmenopausal women) have been shown to lower Lp(a) levels a small amount, but their effect appears to be short-term and it is not known if lowering Lp(a) actually lowers risk."
"If Lp(a) levels don't really change over my lifetime, why would my healthcare practitioner prescribe treatment?","Experts are currently not recommending drug treatments for elevated Lp(a), but some are suggesting that people with elevated Lp(a) and additional risk factors should strive to lower their LDL – the ""bad"" cholesterol, which may help lower their overall risk.. Treatment to lower your LDL cholesterol may help lower your overall risk. (See the article on LDL Cholesterol for details.)"
How widely available are liquid biopsies?,"Liquid biopsies are currently clinically available for only a few cancer types. These include metastatic breast, colon and prostate cancers, and non-small cell lung cancer.
While liquid biopsies continue to become commercially available and in some cases are FDA-approved, more research is needed to understand the benefits and limitations of these tests. For example, it is still unclear if using liquid biopsies to guide treatment actually improves outcomes for people with cancer.
Liquid biopsies are currently most useful in detecting mutations that predict response or resistance to treatment in lung cancer and for evaluating prognosis in select cancers. Over time, these tests may become a part of management of a wider array of cancers. Liquid biopsies are also showing promise as cancer screening tools in research settings, but none are currently FDA-approved as screening tests.
Some experts say that more research is needed before liquid biopsies are used in medical practice. In March 2018, a review jointly published by the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the College of American Pathologists concluded that currently, cell-free tumor DNA tests are not useful outside of clinical trials. The groups say that prospective studies are needed to evaluate how well liquid biopsies perform in diagnosing cancer, but such studies have not yet been conducted. The experts acknowledge, however, that research on these tests is progressing quickly and use of liquid biopsies will likely evolve in the near future."
"If I get a liquid biopsy, will I still need a tissue biopsy?","For diagnosis of your tumor, you will need a conventional tissue biopsy. As mentioned above, if your liquid biopsy is negative for certain mutations, you may need to have follow-up testing done on a conventional biopsy specimen. A liquid biopsy may miss details available from a conventional tissue biopsy and can't determine where in one's body a mutation has arisen.
In some situations, a liquid biopsy alone can provide sufficient information for making treatment decisions. It may be sufficient if, for example, the primary test is positive for a mutation or if a T790M mutation is detected and a tissue biopsy cannot be obtained. While liquid biopsies are promising and powerful tools, they complement but do not necessarily replace tissue biopsies for the foreseeable future."
What tests may be done in follow up to an abnormal liver panel to help determine the cause of liver injury?,"In order to diagnose a liver disease, a healthcare practitioner will evaluate your liver panel test results and consider other factors such as signs, symptoms and clinical and family history. Depending on the results of the liver panel, a healthcare practitioner may suspect a particular cause of liver disorder and order follow-up lab tests and may order a liver biopsy and/or imaging scans to help confirm a diagnosis and determine the extent of liver damage.
Some examples additional lab tests include:



Suspected type of liver disorder
Other or follow-up tests


Viral hepatitis
Acute viral hepatitis panel, hepatitis A testing, hepatitis B testing, hepatitis C testing


Alcohol abuse/hepatitis
GGT, Ethanol, carbohydrate-deficient transferrin


Toxic or drug-induced
Tests for toxins, drugs including drugs of abuse, acetaminophen


Wilson disease
Copper, Cerulosplasmin, eye exam, liver biopsy


Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency
Alpha-1 antitrypsin


Autoimmune
ANA, SMA, anti-LKM-1


Chronic
Liver biopsy


Liver cancer
AFP, DCP"
Are these tests always performed together as a panel?,"No. Each of these tests may be ordered individually. However, if your healthcare practitioner is interested in following two or more individual liver tests, your practitioner may order the entire liver panel because it offers more information. Alternatively, a healthcare provider may order individual tests when monitoring specific conditions."
Why does my doctor want to know all of the medications and supplements I am taking?,"Your healthcare provider will want to evaluate everything you are taking as a whole. Many over-the-counter drugs and herbal or dietary supplements have the potential to affect the liver. Excessive amounts of a drug, and/or a decreased ability to metabolize a drug, and/or a combination of drugs (including over-the-counter drugs and supplements) may injure the liver. For instance, taking too much acetaminophen and/or the combination taking acetaminophen and alcohol or other drugs (e.g., isoniazid and phenobarbital) can cause severe liver damage."
Can I have liver disease if I feel fine?,"Yes, early acute liver disease and chronic liver disease often cause no symptoms or mild nonspecific symptoms, such as fatigue and nausea."
Can I have abnormal test results and not have liver disease?,"Yes, many temporary conditions, such as shock, burns, severe infections, muscle trauma, dehydration, pancreatitis, hemolysis, and pregnancy, can cause one or more of the liver function tests to be abnormal."
Why is my family history important?,"Some liver conditions, such as hemochromatosis, alpha 1- antitrypsin deficiency and Wilson disease, may be inherited and can progressively damage the liver. Early detection of these conditions allows them to be treated and managed appropriately."
Should everyone have an Lp-PLA2 test? ,It is not currently indicated or recommended by major health organizations as a screen for the general population or recommended yet as a primary cardiac risk marker. Your healthcare provider can help you determine the best tests to determine your risk of developing CVD and provide you with information about changes you can make to lower your risk.
How deadly are strokes?,"According to the American Stroke Association, stroke is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and a leading cause of disability. More than 80% of strokes are ischemic."
What are some additional details on LA testing results?,"The following table summarizes some LA testing results that may be seen.



 
Tests
Results
Possible Interpretation


Step 1
LA-sensitive PTT (PTT-LA) and/or dilute Russell viper venom test (DRVVT)

Normal

Usually no further testing is done. If there is a strong suspicion of the presence of an inhibitor, then testing may be repeated.


 
 
Prolonged
Possible inhibitor present; see Step 2


Step 2
Mixing study: Mix equal parts patient plasma with normal pooled plasma and perform PTT-LA or DRVVT

Normal

The initial test results were prolonged due to a cause other than an inhibitor, i.e., deficiency in coagulation factor(s).


 
 
Prolonged
If mixing patient plasma with normal pooled plasma does not ""correct"" the result, then it is likely that lupus anticoagulant is present; see Step 3


Step 3
Confirmation (correction or neutralization test): perform PTT-LA or DRVVT again but add excess phospholipids (e.g., hexagonal phase phospholipid neutralization assay). A normalized ratio is calculated by dividing this result into the result of PTT-LA or DRVVT without excess phospholipids.

Positive (high ratio)

If the ratio is above a specified cutoff, then presence of lupus anticoagulant is suggested.


 
 
Negative (low ratio)
A specific inhibitor rather than lupus anticoagulant may be present. Tests for antibodies directed against coagulation factors, specifically factor VIII, may be performed. Unlike LA that may cause clotting in the body, a factor specific inhibitor can cause severe bleeding.



Based on the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) recommendations, there are four criteria that must be met to confirm the presence of LA:

Prolonged result on at least one of two coagulation tests that are dependent on phospholipids, such as PTT-LA or DRVVT
Prolonged result on a mixing study (evidence of clotting inhibition)
Shortened clotting time occurs after adding excess phospholipids (demonstrates dependence of the inhibitor on phospholipids)
Ruling out coexisting specific coagulation factor inhibitor, such as factor VIII, which could result in catastrophic bleeding if not identified"
Is sample collection critical for lupus anticoagulant (LA) testing?,"Yes. Besides heparin contamination, other pretest variables may have a significant impact on detecting the lupus anticoagulant. The blood sample is collected in a special citrated tube and centrifuged to remove the plasma for testing. There must be the proper amount of blood in the tube and it cannot be clotted. When the blood is properly centrifuged, most of the platelets are removed from the test sample. If there are too many platelets in the plasma sample, test results may be compromised because platelets are a source of phospholipids. Also, if a person's hematocrit is very high, test results may be affected."
Is there anything I can do to get rid of lupus anticoagulant?,"No. You cannot get rid of this autoantibody through any actions on your part such as lifestyle changes. There is no cure, but if you experience signs and symptoms related to LA, there are treatments available that can help decrease your risk of excessive clotting (see below)."
Who is at risk for antiphospholipid syndrome?,"Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) may affect anyone but is most frequently seen in women of child-bearing age and in those with another autoimmune disorder. According to the March of Dimes, APS is the most common acquired excessive clotting disorder (thrombophilia), affecting up to 5% of pregnant women."
"If it is suspected that I have an excessive clotting disorder, what tests other than LA might my doctor use to evaluate my condition?","Other tests used to evaluate excessive clotting may include factor V Leiden mutation and prothrombin gene G20210A mutation, other antiphospholipid antibodies, homocysteine, protein C and protein S, and antithrombin."
I'm having a hard time getting pregnant. What tests do I need?,"Basic tests for infertility often include measuring LH and FSH levels. Your healthcare provider may also ask you to keep track of your body temperature, which rises slightly during ovulation. Other hormonal tests as well as a postcoital (after intercourse) examination may also be done. A hysterosalpingogram (image of fallopian tubes) may be ordered to see whether your fallopian tubes are blocked. Your partner may be asked to give a specimen of semen for analysis."
Can the LH test be used to tell if I have ovulated?,"The LH test is often used to predict ovulation by detecting a woman's monthly pre-ovulation LH surge. It indicates ovulation but cannot, however, be used to confirm that ovulation has occurred."
Why would a man need a test for FSH and LH? I thought these were female hormones.,"Men also produce FSH and LH. These hormone levels are important for the male reproduction process. FSH stimulates the testicles to produce sperm. In men, LH may be measured if testosterone levels are low."
Is there a home test for LH?,"Yes, there is a home test that uses a urine sample to help predict ovulation. For more information, see this FDA website."
Can I do anything to protect myself from becoming infected?,"Yes. If you are in the woods or garden in tick-infested areas, avoid contact with the soil, leaves, and vegetation. Wear closed shoes, light-colored clothing, and use insect repellant containing 20-30% DEET or permethrin. Check your clothing and exposed skin frequently and remove ticks promptly. Animals such as dogs, cats, horses, and cows can also carry the deer tick. Check your pet often, particularly the head, neck, ears, and between the toes. Use a tick repellent prescribed by your veterinarian."
How can I recognize the signs if I don't show the rash?,"The rash appears in up to 75% of those infected. This rash may be the classic ""bull's eye,"" but may also be blotchy or red and may be confused with poison ivy, spider bites, or ringworm. It may appear between a few days and a few weeks after being bitten and can disappear quickly. If possible, take a picture of the rash to show your healthcare provider since the rash may be gone before you can get an appointment.
Other symptoms of Lyme disease include fatigue, chills and fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, and swollen lymph nodes. Check with your healthcare provider if you have any of these symptoms and cannot explain how you got them."
Should I be tested for Lyme disease if I don't have any symptoms?,"Testing people who do not have symptoms is not recommended; the tests tend to have a higher incidence of false positives when this is done. This is true even when someone has been bitten by a deer tick, also known as the black legged tick. Not every tick bite will result in an infection. Not every tick is infected with Borrelia and even with those that are, it typically takes between 24 and 72 hours from the time a tick attaches to a person for the bacterium to be transmitted. If a tick is promptly removed, then the risk of getting Lyme disease is decreased. Those who have been bitten should talk to their healthcare provider if they develop any symptoms or if they have any concerns."
Can ticks be tested for Lyme disease?,"Yes, some state and local public health departments offer testing of ticks as well as identification of the types that transmit Lyme disease. You can check with your health department to see if it offers these. However, testing ticks may not always be useful for a few reasons. Even though a tick is positive for Lyme disease, it does not mean it passed it on to you. If it is negative, it may give false reassurance because you could have been bitten by a different tick that is infected. And if you are infected, you may develop symptoms before you get the tick results. You should not wait for those results if you are ill and should consult your healthcare provider."
Who should have genetic testing for Lynch syndrome?,"The decision about who should be tested is usually based on specific criteria. Your healthcare practitioner may talk to you about the Amsterdam II criteria and/or the revised Bethesda guidelines. These guidelines were developed as screening tools to help determine your likelihood of having Lynch syndrome and whether you should consider being tested for Lynch syndrome. The criteria and guidelines look at colorectal cancer and endometrial cancer in your family history and personal history. According to these guidelines, you should consider further testing for Lynch syndrome in the following circumstances:
Amsterdam II Criteria—testing is recommended if you fit all these criteria:

Three or more relatives with Lynch syndrome-associated cancer, one of whom is a first-degree relative (e.g., mother, father, sibling) of the other two
Cancer involving at least two generations in your family
One or more of the related cancers diagnosed in a relative before 50 years of age

 
Revised Bethesda Guidelines—testing is recommended if you fit any one of these criteria:

Diagnosis of colorectal cancer or endometrial cancer when you are younger than 50 years of age
More than one colon cancer at the same time (synchronous), additional cancers at another time (metachronous), or other Lynch syndrome-associated tumors, regardless of how old you are
Diagnosis of colorectal cancer with a high frequency of microsatellite instability when you are younger than 60 years of age
Diagnosis of colorectal cancer in one or more first-degree relatives (parents, siblings, children) with a Lynch syndrome-related tumor, with one of the diagnoses before 50 years of age
Diagnosis of colorectal cancer in two or more first- or second-degree (uncles, aunts, nieces, nephews or grandparents) relatives with Lynch syndrome-related cancers, at any age

 
Even if you don't fit these criteria, you may still consider genetic testing if you have had a Lynch syndrome-related cancer and results of your tumor tests suggest an increased likelihood of Lynch syndrome."
I was diagnosed with colon cancer and testing was first done on my tumor. Why?,"When a tumor sample (biopsy) is available, testing is often first done to evaluate for a mismatch repair deficiency, microsatellite instability and MLH1 promoter methylation. These tumor tests can help screen patients to identify which patients should then consider genetic testing for Lynch syndrome gene variants, which can sometimes indicate the probable gene involved. (See the Testing section in the article on Lynch Syndrome for more information on tumor testing.)"
How long will it take for Lynch syndrome genetic test results?,"Not every laboratory offers this genetic testing and your blood sample may be sent to a reference laboratory for testing. Depending on the lab, it may take a few weeks."
What other cancers are associated with Lynch syndrome?,"Colon cancer and endometrial cancer are the most common cancers associated with Lynch syndrome, but others include cancer of the bile ducts, brain, kidneys, liver, ovaries, pancreas, skin, small bowel, stomach, and urinary tract. For more information, see the article on Lynch Syndrome or the links in the Related Content section."
Are there other reasons for mismatch repair deficiency or microsatellite instability?,"Yes. Mismatch repair deficiency and/or microsatellite instability is the cause of many colon cancers and endometrial cancers. For example, estimates are that about 12% to 14% of all cases of colorectal cancer have a mismatch repair deficiency. In most cases of colorectal cancer with mismatch repair system problems (70% to 90%), there are acquired (not inherited) genetic changes that cause accidental inactivation or shutdown of the system (promoter methylation of the MLH1 gene). These cases are known as sporadic cancer, or cancer that develops on its own without inherited changes in the mismatch repair genes. These are not related to Lynch syndrome.
Additional tumor testing, such as for BRAF mutation and MLH1 promoter methylation, may be performed to help distinguish between Lynch syndrome-related cancer and non-inherited (sporadic) cancer. (See the article on Lynch Syndrome for more on these tumor tests.)"
"If I have a Lynch syndrome pathogenic gene variant, how is my cancer risk monitored?","If you carry a pathogenic variant in a gene that is known to cause Lynch syndrome, you will want to talk to your healthcare practitioner about screening for colon cancer and possibly other cancers. For example, the American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends that people with Lynch syndrome start colonoscopy screening in their 20s, or 2 to 5 years earlier than the youngest age of related cancer diagnosis in their family. The ACS also recommends screening every 1 to 2 years thereafter. This is earlier and more often than what is recommended in the general population. Screening is done so any cancers that develop can be detected and removed as early as possible. (See the Testing section of the article on Lynch Syndrome for more details on cancer screenings.)"
"Why is this condition primarily called Lynch syndrome, not Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)?","It is known by both names, but Lynch syndrome is now the preferred term. The syndrome is named after Dr. Henry Lynch, who first identified and described the condition.
HNPCC has lost favor as the name because it implies that:

The affected person will not have colon polyps – but in fact, individuals with Lynch syndrome often do have colon polyps.
It is only related to colon cancer – but the condition is also related to a number of other cancers."
How do you know a mismatch repair gene variant is harmful (pathogenic)?,"Laboratory directors and genetics professionals rely on databases and medical literature in order to interpret and correctly classify the results of these tests. Some variants identified by Lynch syndrome testing are already known to be pathogenic, or disease causing, because they have been seen in many other people with Lynch syndrome. Others are predicted to be disease-causing because of their effect on the gene or protein.
A variant may also be considered ""likely pathogenic"" if there is sufficient supporting evidence that it would act in the same manner as a known pathogenic variant. Some gene variants may be identified as ""variants of uncertain significance"" (VUS). A VUS means that the variant has not been reported to be causative of a condition, but that it is also not a frequent variant in the general population (which would support it being a common and benign, or non-disease causing variant). This means that they are not the gene variants that are known to cause Lynch syndrome, but it is not yet known if they should be considered pathogenic.
As knowledge in these areas continues to grow and more information becomes available, the interpretation of ""variants of uncertain significance"" is sometimes downgraded (likely benign or benign) or upgraded (likely pathogenic or pathogenic). Due to the evolving nature of variant interpretation, if your result is classified as a VUS, it is important to work with your healthcare provider to monitor its classification over time."
What are symptoms of low magnesium?,"Low magnesium may cause signs and symptoms such as muscle weakness, twitching, cramping, confusion, changes in heart rate (cardiac arrhythmias), and seizures."
"Should I take magnesium supplements? And if so, how much?",People will absorb and use magnesium at different rates and may be taking drugs that affect magnesium levels. You should talk to your healthcare provider about what is appropriate for your situation.
"Besides urine and saliva, what other types of samples may be used for marijuana testing?","Some laboratories offer marijuana testing on samples of blood and hair.

A blood sample can be collected by inserting a needle into a vein and drawing blood into a tube.
Hair may be tested and is usually collected from the crown of the head, although hair may also be collected from other parts of the body.

Newborns may undergo testing when the mother is known or suspected to have used drugs, such as marijuana, during the last trimester of pregnancy. In these cases, samples of meconium, a newborn's first bowel movement are typically collected by healthcare practitioners soon after babies are born. In recent years, umbilical cord tissue has gained more attention in drug testing after delivery instead of meconium as it can be collected immediately following birth."
Can THC screening detect if I’m using medical marijuana or a prescribed form of cannabis?,"THC testing cannot distinguish between marijuana obtained via a medical card and marijuana obtained for recreational use.
Marijuana tests also cannot distinguish between THC from the cannabis plant and FDA-approved purified or synthetic prescription forms of THC."
Are the illicit synthetic forms of marijuana such as K2 and Spice the same thing as THC and can they be detected by marijuana testing?,"The illicit synthetic cannabinoids such as K2 or Spice are not THC. These are mind-altering chemicals in liquid form that can be vaporized and inhaled using devices such as e-cigarettes or sprayed on to plant material so it can be smoked. The chemicals bind to the same brain receptors and may be marketed as synthetic THC or synthetic marijuana, but they are not the same substance. Illicit synthetic cannabinoids can have unpredictable and potentially life-threatening effects on the body, including seizures, brain swelling, and heart palpitations. Because these chemicals are not THC, they will not be detected with tests specific for THC or THC-COOH. A test that is specifically designed to detect the synthetic compound in K2 or Spice is needed. Even these tests don't necessarily detect all the synthetic cannabinoids that can be present in any given ""spice"" material."
Can I test positive from secondhand smoke?,"Yes, though it is unlikely to occur at typical screening cutoffs. Research studies have shown that secondhand cannabis smoke can produce positive tests in non-smokers. However, it depended on the THC potency of the marijuana. Room ventilation also helped reduce THC exposure levels."
Can I be fired from my job for testing positive for marijuana in areas of the U.S. where it has been legalized?,"Marijuana is legal for medicinal use in several states, and legal for recreational use in a fewer number of states plus Washington D.C. In these areas, U.S. federal employees and employees of federally-regulated industries are still prohibited from using marijuana and state law may not protect them from termination if they test positive for THC. State law may also not protect individuals whose private employers wish to fire them for using marijuana."
What can cause false-positive results in a marijuana test?,"False positives have been reported for THC screening tests, which is why many positive screens are confirmed with a more specific test. The causes of false-positive screening results are not always able to be identified.
The chemical signatures of marijuana metabolites are unique and not likely to be mistaken for many other legal substances in a confirmation test. In older tests, ibuprofen could lead to false-positive screening results, but this is no longer the case.
The only substances that will cause a positive on confirmation tests are those that actually contain THC."
How long will a drug test detect THC after marijuana use?,"Detection times for THC vary widely and depend on a number of factors. These include the dose of THC, frequency of use, an individual's metabolism and the type of sample tested. For example, THC can be detected in urine anywhere from 3 days to more than 30 days after use."
Why would collection of a urine sample need to be observed by a healthcare professional?,"Some individuals attempting to evade drug testing will try to submit another person's urine sample or a commercial product as their own urine sample for testing. To prevent this practice of sample substitution, some legal entities may require that collection of the urine sample be observed by a healthcare practitioner or other professional."
Are there other non-invasive screening tests for these disorders?,"A newer test called cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) only requires a blood sample from the pregnant woman and can be used to screen for certain fetal chromosomal abnormalities, including Down syndrome, Edwards syndrome, and Patau syndrome (trisomy 13). It can be performed as early as the tenth week of pregnancy. It does not, however, screen for neural tube defects like spina bifida. Invasive diagnostic tests, such as chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and amniocentesis, are still needed to confirm the results of cffDNA. Since cffDNA screening is a relatively new test, some insurance companies may not cover it and it may not be available everywhere. For more information, see the article on Cell-Free Fetal DNA."
I am pregnant. Will I have both first and second trimester screening performed?,"There are several approaches to screening depending on what technology is available where you are and when you first visit your healthcare practitioner for prenatal care. Options include:
• First trimester screening for chromosome abnormalities using the combined tests for pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), hCG and nuchal translucency ultrasound, followed by a blood test for maternal AFP and/or a fetal ultrasound in the second trimester to check for neural tube defects
• Second trimester screening (triple or quad screen) to assess risk for chromosome abnormalities and neural tube defects; this may be the only testing done, especially in the case of a woman who does not visit her healthcare practitioner until the second trimester.
• Cell-free fetal DNA testing in the first or second trimester with a blood test for maternal AFP and/or a fetal ultrasound in the second trimester to check for neural tube defects
Typically, if first trimester screening for chromosome disorders has been performed, then screening in the second trimester is not performed because the risks for Down syndrome and Edwards syndrome have already been assessed. However, if you and your healthcare practitioner wish to use the results of both first trimester Down syndrome screen combined tests and the second trimester maternal serum screen to assess the risk of chromosome abnormalities, then one of the following approaches is used:
• Integrated screening – involves performing both first and second trimester testing and not releasing the results until all testing is completed
• Sequential screening – involves performing a first trimester screen; if the screen indicates increased risk for Down syndrome or Edwards syndrome, a diagnostic procedure such as chorionic villus sampling is offered. If the screen does not indicate increased risk, then a triple or quad screen in the second trimester is offered and results from both the first and second trimester screens are used in the final risk assessment."
"If I have measles or mumps and develop complications, will they go away once the infection resolves?","In most cases they will, but some complications, such as blindness, deafness, and rarely tissue or organ damage, may be permanent. The swelling of testicles (orchitis) that is sometimes seen with mumps can occasionally cause infertility."
When do people typically get measles and mumps vaccinations?,"Two doses of the MMR vaccine are needed for full protection. Children are given the first dose of MMR vaccine between 12 and 15 months of age and a booster immunization is typically given before the start of kindergarten between 4 and 6 years of age.
The measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine contains a live, attenuated (weakened) form of the viruses. Those with weakened immune systems and women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant within the next month should not receive the vaccine. The initial dose of the vaccine is recommended for infants at 12-15 months of age and a second dose is given at 4-6 years of age."
Should everyone be tested for measles and mumps immunity?,"A test to document antibody response to the MMR vaccine is not recommended since most people produce an antibody response to the viruses in the vaccine. There are several common situations, such as entry to a university or employment in a health care setting, where you may need to provide proof that you have had the measles and mumps infections, or that you have had two MMR vaccinations, or that you have immunity to measles and mumps infection."
Is it ok for pregnant women and young children to eat fish?,"The high levels of mercury found in certain fish may harm the developing nervous systems in unborn babies and young children. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that pregnant women, women who may become pregnant, young children, and nursing mothers avoid eating fish with increased mercury levels, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel and tilefish. It advises these groups to eat fish that are usually found to have lower levels of mercury such as canned light tuna, shrimp, or salmon. (See the Related Content section for their advice.)"
Do silver teeth fillings contain mercury?,"Yes. Dental amalgams (teeth fillings) are made up of about 50% metallic mercury. Some people feel that the tiny amount of mercury vapor released when a person chews may affect their health, but internationally most major health organizations feel that the amalgams are safe at this time. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined that dental amalgams are safe for adults and children over age 6. A few countries have begun to restrict their use as a precaution."
What types of fish have higher levels of mercury?,"Predator fish, those that eat other fish, have higher levels of mercury. Some of these include shark, swordfish, tilefish, and king mackerel. Some fish with lower levels of mercury include shrimp, canned light tuna, pollock, salmon, and catfish."
What can I do to reduce my exposure to mercury?,"In addition to avoiding consumption of fish known to harbor higher levels of mercury, you can avoid purchase and use of consumer products that contain mercury, such as thermostats and thermometers, and alternative medicines that contain mercury. These include some Hispanic folk remedies and Ayurvedic herbal preparations. Dispose of batteries, light-up novelty toys, thermometers, thermostats, and other mercury-containing items, including compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs), in hazardous waste facilities. Finally, exercise caution when handling CFLs, especially if you break one."
Why would my healthcare provider recommend a folate supplement when I am taking methotrexate?,"Some of the side effects associated with methotrexate use, such as increase in the plasma concentration of homocysteine, are due to decreased folate levels. Healthcare practitioners may recommend folate supplementation to help minimize symptoms."
Do I need to let my other healthcare providers know that I am taking methotrexate?,"Yes, this is important information for all your healthcare providers, including your dentist, to have. This is because of possible drug interactions and because methotrexate suppresses your immune system."
What else is methotrexate used for?,"Although it is most commonly used as treatment for cancer, sever psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate is sometimes used as a treatment for ectopic (tubal) pregnancies and may be prescribed for conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Crohn disease, asthma, and lupus."
Why do I need to avoid live vaccines while I am taking methotrexate?,"Live vaccines contain weakened microorganisms that are intended to stimulate a person's immune system to create antibodies for protection against a specific infection. Since methotrexate depresses the immune system, the body's immune system is less able to respond appropriately."
My newborn had an MMA test done. Why?,"Occasionally, specialized MMA testing may be ordered to help diagnose methylmalonic acidemia. Moderately to severely elevated levels of MMA may be seen in infants with the rare inherited metabolic disorder methylmalonic acidemia, caused by genetic mutations of chromosome 6.
An acutely ill infant with methylmalonic acidemia who shows sepsis, poor feeding, lethargy, and vomiting may progress to coma and death if not promptly treated. Laboratory testing for ketones, lactic acid, ammonia, hypoglycemia, decreased blood cell counts, and elevated C3 acylcarnitines and organic acids in the urine may be done. MMA testing may also be ordered.
Methylmalonic acidemia occurs in about 1 in 25,000 to 100,000 newborns. Screening for this disorder is part of mandatory programs in all 50 states in the U.S. Babies with this disease are unable to convert methylmalonyl CoA to succinyl CoA. They appear normal at birth, but as they consume protein, they begin to show symptoms such as excessive tiredness, vomiting, dehydration, weak muscle tone, seizures, mental retardation, strokes, and severe metabolic acidosis.
For more information, see the Newborn Screening article."
"If I have an elevated MMA, why might my doctor hesitate to diagnose me with vitamin B12 deficiency?","If your B12 test result is in the lower end of the normal range and you do not present with significant clinical symptoms, your healthcare provider may feel that you have adequate B12 and will rely on these findings rather than an elevated MMA. This may be especially true if your homocysteine level is normal. Your healthcare provider may want to monitor your condition over time and may be reluctant to start you on what could be lifelong treatment with B12 injections and/or oral supplementation unless it is truly necessary."
Can either blood or urine be used for the MMA test?,"In most cases, it is okay to use blood or urine for this test. Sometimes, a healthcare provider may want to test both blood and urine in order to compare the MMA results. Since homocysteine is a blood test, it may be more efficient and convenient to draw blood for both the MMA and homocysteine tests when they are ordered together."
 How serious is a case of infectious mononucleosis?,"The symptoms of the disease usually resolve with supportive treatment, such as plenty of rest and fluids, in one to four months. Sometimes, your spleen or liver may enlarge and you may have to limit your activity until these organs return to normal size. Heart problems or involvement of the central nervous system occur only rarely. Infectious mononucleosis may cause severe liver failure in males with a special XLP gene. In this rare case, mononucleosis can be fatal."
"Is mononucleosis really a ""kissing disease""?","The spread of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) requires contact with the saliva of an infected person as occurs with kissing; however, kissing does not have to occur for infection to arise. Saliva on children's toys, water bottles, toothbrushes, drinking glasses, and hands can also transmit the virus. Transmission of this virus through the air or blood does not normally occur. The incubation period, or the time from infection to appearance of symptoms, ranges from 4 to 6 weeks.
People who have infectious mononucleosis can spread the infection to others for a period of weeks. Many healthy people who have been previously infected can carry and spread the virus intermittently for life, and testing them for the virus is not practical. For these reasons, it is almost impossible to prevent spreading the virus and nearly everyone will have had an EBV infection, but not necessarily mono, by the time that they are 40 years old."
Does the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) cause chronic fatigue syndrome?,"To date, there is no laboratory evidence indicating that EBV infection causes chronic fatigue syndrome. For more information, visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's web page on Chronic Fatigue Syndrome."
Can I get infectious mononucleosis more than once?,"Although the symptoms of infectious mononucleosis usually go away in 1 or 2 months, EBV remains inactive in a few cells in the body for the rest of the person's life. Periodically, the virus can reactivate, and it is commonly found in the saliva of infected persons. This reactivation usually occurs without symptoms of illness."
Can EBV cause other serious illnesses?,"EBV has been linked to certain cancers, such as Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and AIDS-related lymphoma, and continues to be studied for possible linkages to other cancers. The incidence of these diseases is low, and cases of Burkitt's lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma occur primarily outside of the United States."
Who performs MTHFR testing?,"It is not offered in every laboratory. In most cases, your blood will be sent to a reference laboratory for testing."
Can my MTHFR genes change?,"No, you inherit a copy of the gene from each of your parents and they will not change over time."
"If I have the same MTHFR gene mutations as a relative, why is my homocysteine level significantly different?","Even when two people have the same MTHFR mutations, the results and their risks are often different. Many things can affect homocysteine levels, including MTHFR enzyme activity, folate or other B vitamin levels, and a person's health status."
"In addition to MPA levels, what other tests might be ordered?","Since MPA can lower white blood cell counts and cause anemia, a healthcare practitioner usually orders a complete blood count (CBC) along with MPA to evaluate the blood cells. Other tests, such as a liver panel or renal panel, may also be periodically ordered to evaluate organ function since MPA levels can be affected by changes in kidney and liver function."
How long will I need to be on mycophenolate?,"Typically, mycophenolate is given long term, but it depends on your condition and how you respond to the drug. Mycophenolate is one choice in an array of medications that may be used to help treat your condition. If you are a transplant patient, you must take an immunosuppressant (or combination of drugs) throughout your life. If you are a patient with an autoimmune disorder, then you will be prescribed medications to help limit damage to your body and to alleviate symptoms. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best choices for your condition. These choices may change over time."
Where are mycophenolic acid tests performed?,"Mycophenolic acid tests may be performed in a local hospital laboratory but will frequently be sent to a reference laboratory. Because different laboratories use different methods and will have slightly different reference ranges, your healthcare practitioner will usually send your tests consistently to one laboratory for testing."
Should I tell my other healthcare providers that I am taking mycophenolate?,"Yes. This is important information for them, partially because of drug interactions and partially because of the immunosuppressant action of mycophenolic acid. It can affect your ability to heal, to get vaccinations, and may increase the risk of developing certain cancers, including skin cancers and lymphoma."
Why haven't I heard about mycoplasmas?,"They are a common but often unidentified cause of respiratory infections. Like the viruses that cause the common cold, they tend to cause mild to moderate, nonspecific cold symptoms in most people and, in most cases, they are self-limited, resolving without treatment or with prescribed antibiotics."
Can mycoplasma infections be avoided?,"Mycoplasmas are very common in the environment and it is not always possible to prevent infection. Those caused by outbreaks of Mycoplasma pneumoniae are transmitted through respiratory droplets and may be avoided through good hand washing, covering the nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing, and avoiding close contact with sick people. Mycoplasmas that are passed through sexual contact can be prevented in the same manner as other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Those passed from mother to baby are difficult to predict or prevent."
Can testing for mycoplasma be performed in my doctor's office?,"Samples may be collected in your healthcare practitioner's office, but testing requires specialized equipment and will need to be done in a hospital or reference laboratory."
What drugs can cause rhabdomyolysis?,"Some examples include:

Drugs of abuse such as alcohol (ethanol), heroin and cocaine
Antibiotics (amphotericin B, ampicillin)
Anesthetics
Antidepressants
Antihistamines
Aspirin (salicylates)
Corticosteroids
Lidocaine
Lithium
Statins (used to treat high cholesterol)
Theophylline"
Should everyone with muscle pain and weakness have a myoglobin test?,"General, routine testing for myoglobin is usually not necessary. Muscle pain and weakness are common symptoms of many temporary conditions that go away without specific treatment. However, if someone is taking a drug or has been exposed to a substance that has been linked with potential muscle damage, then testing may be warranted."
Are myoglobin tests used to help diagnose heart attacks?,"Myoglobin blood tests have been used along with troponin tests as cardiac biomarkers to help detect a heart attack early. However, in the U.S., myoglobin testing is used less frequently for detecting heart attacks early and more recent studies have indicated that newer markers (e.g., troponin) are better for this purpose.
The level of myoglobin in the blood starts to rise within 2-3 hours of a heart attack or other muscle injury, reaches its highest levels within 8-12 hours, and generally falls back to normal within one day. An increase in myoglobin is detectable sooner than troponin, but it is not as specific for heart damage and it will not stay elevated as long as troponin.
If myoglobin does not increase within 12 hours following the onset of chest pain, a heart attack is very unlikely. Although a negative myoglobin result effectively rules out a heart attack, a positive result must be confirmed by testing for troponin."
Do any forms of tobacco not contain nicotine?,"No, they all contain nicotine. This includes pipe tobacco, cigars, snuff, chewing tobacco, etc. If you use any of these, nicotine may be detected in your system."
Can e-cigarettes and vaping cause a positive nicotine result?,"E-cigarettes and other electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) use concentrated liquids that are heated to produce a vapor that is then inhaled. The concentrates may contain nicotine, nicotine and flavorings, or just flavorings. If nicotine is present in the concentrate, then it may be detected in your system. This concentrate also poses a risk for accidental nicotine poisoning. The ENDS products are currently thought to be less harmful than smoking, but the medical community is concerned about their growing popularity. Because they are relatively new, their long-term health effects have yet to be determined."
How is non-HDL cholesterol calculated?,"The level of non-HDL cholesterol (non-HDL-C) is calculated from the total cholesterol (TC) and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations, using a simple equation:
non-HDL-C = TC - HDL-C
The concentration expressed in mg/dl or mmol/l."
Does testing non-HDL-C have some advantages compared to LDL-C?,"The concentration of non-HDL-C is considered as a useful parameter in assessing the risk of coronary heart disease, comparable to LDL-C. Adding non-HDL-C to the traditional lipid profile has many advantages:

Non-HDL-C is calculated from a simple equation, based on total cholesterol and HDL-C levels, thus its measurement is easily available even in small laboratories and doesn't require additional costs.
It reflects cholesterol levels in all lipoprotein fractions that could increase risk for heart disease.
In contrast to LDL-C calculated from the Friedewald formula, non-HDL-C concentration is not associated with errors due to high triglycerides (e.g., in patients with diabetes and metabolic syndrome). Furthermore, it is possible to perform this test in patients who have not fasted.
Several population-based studies have shown a strong correlation between the concentration of non-HDL-C and apoliporotein B (apo B), a protein component of lipoproteins that increases CVD risk. If non-HDL-C is measured, there is no need to measure apo B.
Patients with elevated levels of non-HDL-C and yet normal levels of LDL-C often have an increased number of LDL particles, increased apo B or increased small, dense LDL particles and these are associated with an increased risk of CVD. Therefore non-HDL-C might be more valuable indicator of cardiovascular risk than LDL-C."
Should I ask my healthcare practitioner about having NIPS performed?,"NIPS that uses cfDNA testing is only one of the options that may be offered for prenatal screening for chromosome disorders and it may not be routinely offered by your healthcare practitioner. If you are interested in NIPS, you may choose to discuss it as well as other options with your healthcare practitioner to make an informed decision. You may also be referred to a genetic counselor to help you better understand the limitations and benefits of screening as well as the significance of a ""screen positive"" versus a ""screen negative"" result."
"Besides NIPS, what are the other options for prenatal screening?","Other options include:

First trimester maternal serum screening—includes an ultrasound exam to measure the thickness of a space at the back of the fetus's neck (nuchal translucency) and blood tests to measure pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).
Second trimester maternal serum screening—includes blood tests for alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin and unconjugated estriol (triple screen) or includes those three tests plus inhibin A (quad screen).
Integrated screening, which combines first and second trimester screening results.

If any of these screening tests are positive for an increased risk of a chromosomal disorder, the recommendation is to offer diagnostic testing by CVS or amniocentesis. It is not recommended to perform multiple screening tests, so while NIPS is sometimes offered following a positive serum screen result, the appropriate course of action is to offer diagnostic testing.
The screening approach a woman chooses depends on her preferences, what technology is available through her healthcare practitioner or local hospital, as well as when she first seeks prenatal care.
Ultimately, you should discuss available prenatal screening and diagnostic testing options with your healthcare provider or a genetics specialist, such as a genetic counselor. Post-test genetic counseling for women with a positive screening or diagnostic result is recommended."
"If I have a negative NIPS with my current pregnancy, will I need to repeat it with the next baby?","NIPS may be a screening option for you in any of your pregnancies. Since it is the baby's placental cfDNA that is being assessed, each pregnancy is evaluated separately."
How long does it take for NIPS results?,"Results are typically available in less than one week, but different laboratories have different result turn-around times, so it is best to check with the lab performing your NIPS."
Does NIPS test for open neural tube defects such as spina bifida?,"No. NIPS cannot detect open neural tube defects or abdominal wall defects. Screening for these conditions is typically performed by a detailed ultrasound in the second trimester as well as a second trimester blood test called alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) serum screening. To learn more, read the article on Second Trimester Maternal Serum Screening."
Will this test tell me the sex of my baby?,"It depends on the type of NIPS your healthcare practitioner orders and the specific lab that does the testing. Many laboratories routinely offer screening for five chromosomes: 21, 18, 13, X and Y. If this is the case, NIPS will show you the predicted sex of your baby. Remember that false negatives and false positives occur in screening tests. If you do not want to know the predicted sex of your baby, it might be possible for the lab to only report on the sex chromosomes if there is a sex chromosome abnormality (but not if it is a normal male or a normal female). If not, you can request that a note is placed in your file indicating that you do not want to know the baby's sex."
How is the serum osmolal gap calculated?,Serum osmolal gap = serum osmolality (measured) – serum osmolality (calculated)
My doctor ordered a stool osmolality test. Why?,"A stool osmolality test may sometimes be used to help evaluate chronic diarrhea that does not appear to be due to a bacterial or parasitic infection or to another identifiable cause such as intestinal inflammation or damage. For the test, a fresh (refrigerated or frozen within about 30 minutes of collection), liquid stool that is not contaminated by urine is collected in a clean container. Bacteria in the stool can change the results of the test within a short period of time.
People with watery chronic diarrhea may have an osmotically active substance, such as a commercial laxative, that is inhibiting the reabsorption of water by the intestines. Sometimes a stool osmolal gap is also calculated. An increased stool osmolal gap with chronic diarrhea is likely caused by an osmotically active substance, which can be seen with malabsorption and laxative abuse."
What is the difference between urine osmolality and specific gravity?,"Specific gravity is a common part of a urinalysis. It evaluates the weight of solids in water. Osmolality and specific gravity usually change in parallel to each other. When large and heavy molecules (such as glucose and protein) are present in the urine, however, the results will diverge. Specific gravity will be increased more, due to the weight of the molecules, while urine osmolality will be increased less, reflecting the number of molecules. Generally, osmolality is considered a more exact measurement of urine concentration than specific gravity."
What is the difference between osmolality and osmolarity?,"Osmolality measures the concentration of solutes in a fluid by looking at the number of particles per weight (kilogram) of fluid. Osmolarity evaluates the number of particles per volume (liter) of fluid. With dilute fluids, they are essentially the same, but differences will be more noticeable at higher concentrations and care must be taken when comparing them as the units for osmolality and osmolarity are not the same."
Will an O&P detect all parasites?,"No, it will only detect those that live in the digestive tract and whose eggs are passed through the stool. There are other tests specific for other parasites, such as pinworms, or blood parasites that cause malaria."
Why does it need to be a fresh stool sample?,"The structure of the parasites may deteriorate in unpreserved stool, which would destroy the identifying features of the parasite and make your infection more difficult to diagnose."
Are those parasitic worms I'm seeing in my stool sample?,Most of the common parasites are much too small to be seen with the naked eye. What you are probably noticing are undigested food fibers. The only way to be sure is for a trained health professional to look at the sample under the microscope. Parasites have characteristic external and internal structures that fibers do not have.
Are there other ways to test for intestinal parasites besides a stool exam?,"Yes, blood antibody tests may be ordered to determine whether or not someone has been exposed to a parasite in the past. A positive result may indicate a past or a chronic infection but is not used to detect a current infection. Sometimes a biopsy of the small intestines is taken and the small amount of tissue is examined for parasitic infestation."
"Once I've had a parasitic infection, can I be re-infected?","Yes, you can become re-infected if exposed again. This may happen if you eat or drink something that is contaminated or you have a family member who has an asymptomatic parasitic infection, such as giardiasis, and continues to shed the organisms and re-infects others. The infection can be spread to others until everyone is effectively treated."
Why shouldn't I take an over the counter anti-diarrhea medicine?,"You should only take this on the advice of your healthcare provider. Diarrhea is one of the methods your body uses to help rid itself of the infection. If you slow down or prevent this from happening by taking anti-diarrhea medication, you can prolong the amount of time that you are ill and may make your infection worse."
Understanding Your Pap Smear (Pap Test) Report,"In 2014, a task force updated the classification system for reporting Pap smear (Pap test) results, called the Bethesda System. The Bethesda System terminology was originally developed in 1988. The 2014 review of the system incorporated minimal changes to the earlier version but refined some positions and content.
Bethesda System Terminology:
Important Sections of the Report and the New Terminology
Specimen Adequacy: Each laboratory must report if the cervical sample obtained for the test was adequate (that is, if enough cells were present on the slide to be examined) and if the quality of the slide was satisfactory for examining under the microscope. Before looking at the results, one should always check to see if the specimen was marked ""Satisfactory."" If ""unsatisfactory,"" the reasons will be given and the test will have to be repeated in 2 or 3 months.
Interpretation/Results: This is where the important findings from looking at the cells are reported. There are four different sections:

Negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy
Other: Endometrial cells present in a woman age 40 or more
Epithelial Cell Abnormalities
Other Malignancies


Negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy: 
This is where a ""normal"" result is reported, as well as abnormal findings not related to the risk of cancer. There are two important subcategories:

ORGANISMS: This is where evidence of an infection is reported. Examples include a fungal (yeast) infection (e.g., Candida), Trichomonas, and herpes.
OTHER NON-NEOPLASTIC FINDINGS: This is where evidence of injury and response to injury, previously termed ""Benign Cellular Changes,"" is reported. (Non-neoplastic means the findings are not related to abnormal growth of cells.)


Other: Endometrial cells present in a woman age 40 or more:
This section is used to alert the healthcare provider that endometrial cells (cells from the lining of the uterus) are present when they normally should not be. This is a check on the status of the uterus and endometrium and not the cervix. When a woman is having monthly periods, endometrial cells are often present near the time of a period. After menopause, however, they should not be present. If you are still having periods even though you are over age 40, you and your healthcare practitioner may choose to disregard this part of the report.
Epithelial Cell Abnormality:
This section is where abnormalities that are associated with the risk of developing cancer are reported. The abnormalities range from changes that are only slightly abnormal to definite cancer. There are two types of epithelial cells in the cervix (squamous and glandular) and changes in each are listed.
The lists below are arranged so that the potential for cancer increases as you move down the list, with the last bullets listing invasive cancers.
Squamous Abnormalities (cells that cover most of the external part of the cervix)

Atypical Squamous Cells: Unknown Significance (ASC-US)
Atypical Squamous Cells: cannot exclude HSIL or high-grade changes (ASC-H)
Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (LSIL)
High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (HSIL); one subcategory: ""with features suspicious for malignancy""
Squamous Cell Carcinoma


Glandular Abnormalities (cover the lining of the uterus opening and canal)

Atypical cells, not otherwise specified (AGC)
Atypical cells, favor neoplastic
Adenocarcinoma in situ is a cancer limited to the surface that has not invaded.
Adenocarcinoma can be endometrial (uterus), endocervical (cervix), extrauterine (origin from outside uterus and cervix), or the site of the malignancy cannot be determined based on the Pap smear.


Glandular abnormalities are much less common than squamous abnormalities.
Other Malignancies:
Malignant tumors other than primary squamous carcinoma and glandular adenocarcinoma are occasionally seen on a Pap smear and they are reported here.
Note: There are over 28.5 million Pap smears done in the US each year and approximately 13,000 new cancers are reported. The odds of a positive Pap smear for cancer are quite small.
It is important that if you do not understand your Pap smear results, you ask your healthcare practitioner for clarification. Many of the abnormal findings reported on a Pap smear are either benign, resolve on their own, or are treatable. However, regular cervical cancer screening remains important to ensure that any potentially serious problems are detected promptly."
Does an abnormal Pap test always mean cancer?,"In a small percentage of cases it may mean cancer, but in general a single ""abnormal"" Pap smear does not necessarily indicate that cancer is present. The lining of the cervix undergoes constant changes and repair. You may have additional testing and/or procedures to help determine whether the abnormal Pap smear is significant.
Depending on your age and medical history, you may be monitored more closely (e.g., a repeat Pap smear in a year) to see if the abnormal cells are cleared, or you may have an HPV test if it has not already been done. Depending on those results, additional tests, procedures, and/or treatment may be done."
Do I need a Pap smear if I have an HPV test done?,"Current guidelines state that HPV tests alone may be an adequate cervical cancer screening tool for some women. You should have a discussion with your healthcare provider about the pros and cons of HPV testing with or without Pap smears, so you can decide which approach is best for you based on your lifestyle and health history."
Do I need cervical cancer testing even if I've had the HPV vaccine?,"You should continue to undergo regular cervical cancer screening even if you have been vaccinated against HPV because the vaccine does not offer protection against all HPV types and not all cervical cancers are a result of HPV infection. Additionally, the vaccine does not provide protection against cervical cancer and other HPV-related diseases if you have already been exposed to one or more HPV types at the time of your vaccination.
For more information about the HPV vaccine, see the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Test article."
Why do I need regular Pap smears or HPV tests?,"Cervical cancer is a slow, progressive disease and may take years to advance beyond the cervix. Because of this fact, regular gynecologic examinations and screening tests are necessary to detect precancerous cells and allow removal of affected tissue. Regular exams can also detect cervical cancer early if it does develop. With early detection, cervical cancer is easier to treat. Left unchecked, however, it is almost always fatal. "
What are the risk factors for cervical cancer?,"The most important risk factor for cervical cancer is infection with high-risk types of human papilloma virus (HPV). That is why HPV tests are now recommended in conjunction with a Pap smear for women who are 30 to 65 years of age.
According to the National Cancer Institute, additional factors can further raise cervical cancer risk after an HPV infection. These include having given birth to more than 3 children, long-term oral contraceptive use, and cigarette smoking.
Increased risk is also associated with beginning sexual intercourse at an early age, having multiple sexual partners, exposure to a drug called diethylstilbestrol (DES) before birth, a previous diagnosis of cervical cancer or precancerous changes to the cervix, and a weakened immune system, for example after an organ transplant or from HIV infection."
Can I have an abnormal PTH level without having symptoms?,"Yes, if your calcium level changes slowly, you may not have any noticeable symptoms. In this case, the imbalance will most likely be detected by finding an abnormal calcium level during a regular health check, then checking your PTH level."
What does vitamin D have to do with PTH?,"If you do not have enough vitamin D, your body will not be able to absorb calcium properly. Vitamin D regulates the intestinal absorption of calcium, while PTH regulates the activation of vitamin D. Too much or too little vitamin D can cause an imbalance in calcium metabolism. During winter months with less sun exposure, especially further from the equator, vitamin D levels are typically lower and PTH levels may therefore be higher. Diet and illness may affect the magnitude of these changes."
What other tests could be useful in assessing PTH?,"Other testing may include:

Total and ionized calcium
Phosphorus (phosphate)
Vitamin D (25-(OH) vitamin D and 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D)"
"If I can't absorb vitamin B12, how can I get enough?","Periodic B12 injections can be given. If you are able to absorb some B12, then high doses of oral supplementation may help. You should consult with your healthcare practitioner for specific, appropriate treatment options."
Should everyone have a parietal cell antibody test?,No. It is not intended as a general screening test. It is usually only performed when a person has a demonstrated vitamin B12 deficiency to help determine the cause.
"In addition to a PTT, what other tests might be done?","Examples of other testing that may be done along with a PTT or in follow up to abnormal results include:

Platelet count – should always be monitored during heparin therapy to promptly detect any heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
Thrombin time testing – sometimes ordered to help rule out heparin contamination
Fibrinogen testing – may be done to rule out a low level of fibrinogen as a cause of a prolonged PTT
When an initial PTT is prolonged, a second PTT test is performed by mixing the person's plasma with pooled normal plasma (a collection of plasma from a number of normal donors). If the PTT time returns to normal (""corrects""), it suggests a deficiency of one or more of the coagulation factors in the person's plasma. If the time remains prolonged, then the problem may be due to the presence of an abnormal factor-specific factor inhibitor (autoantibody) or nonspecific inhibitor, such as lupus anticoagulant.
Coagulation factor tests – these measure the activity (function) of coagulation factors. They can detect reduced levels of the protein or proteins that don't work properly (have reduced function). Rarely, the antigen level (quantity) of a coagulation factor may also be measured.
Dilute Russell viper venom test (DRVVT) – a test that may be done if the presence of lupus anticoagulant is suspected (See the page on Lupus Anticoagulant Testing for more on this.)
von Willebrand factor – sometimes ordered to help determine if von Willebrand disease (severe form) is the cause of a prolonged PTT."
Is the PTT always used to monitor heparin therapy?,"In a few situations, it is not.

When very high doses of heparin are used, as may occur during open-heart surgery, the PTT loses its sensitivity; it will not clot. At this intense level of anticoagulation, the activated clotting time (ACT) can be used as a monitoring tool.
Some hospitals now monitor standard (unfractionated) heparin therapy using the chromogenic anti-factor Xa test in lieu of PTT.
Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is a fast-acting form of heparin often used in the treatment of conditions such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention. Though generally not requiring monitoring, it must be monitored using the anti-factor Xa test because LMWH typically does not prolong PTT.
For people with lupus anticoagulant and clotting and who are being treated with heparin, the PTT is not reliable; thus the anti-factor Xa test must be used to monitor their heparin therapy."
How can I change my PTT?,"The PTT is not something you can change through lifestyle changes (unless you have a vitamin K deficiency). It is a reflection of the integrity of your clotting system. If your PTT is prolonged due to acquired factor deficiencies, then addressing the underlying condition may bring the results to near normal levels. If they are prolonged due to a temporary or acute condition, they should return to normal on their own when the acute condition is resolved. Inherited coagulation abnormalities or deficiencies should be closely monitored and may be treated with frequent replacement infusions of the missing clotting factor."
Is this the same parvovirus that affects dogs and cats? Can I catch it from my pet?,"No. Different types of parvovirus infect humans and animals. You cannot get parvovirus from your pets, and they cannot catch it from you."
Can my test be performed in my healthcare practitioner's office?,"No, parvovirus B19 testing requires specialized equipment to perform. Your sample will usually be sent to a reference laboratory."
Can I skip the digital rectal exam (DRE) and just collect a urine sample?,"No, the DRE is a very necessary part of the sample collection. The procedure releases prostate cells and PCA3 into the urine, where it can be detected. This is why it is also important to collect the first amount of urine after the DRE – so the released PCA3 is present in the urine sample."
Can the test be performed in my healthcare practitioner's office?,"The DRE will be performed in your healthcare practitioner's office and, most likely, so will the urine collection as it is the first urine collected after the DRE. However, the testing requires specialized equipment and your sample will be sent to a laboratory for testing. Not all labs perform this test, so your sample may be sent to a reference laboratory."
Will PCA3 testing detect all prostate cancers?,"No, it is not over-expressed in every cancer, so about 10% of prostate cancers will have normal PCA3 results."
How long does it take for PD-L1 testing results?,"PD-L1 testing is not available in every laboratory. Depending on the test method used and whether or not a healthcare practitioner sends a sample to a reference laboratory, the results may take several days before they are available."
Can I have my blood tested instead of having a tissue biopsy?,"For diagnosis of your tumor, you will need a tissue biopsy. Tissue cells from this biopsy are also required for PD-L1 testing."
Is testing before treatment really necessary?,"Testing is required for cancers and drug combinations identified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as needing ""companion diagnostic testing."" Testing is common and considered the best practice when the combination is identified as ""complementary diagnostic testing."" Use of immunotherapy drugs continues to evolve. As things change and more data become available, practices will also continue to change. Consult with your healthcare practitioner."
What are some side effects of immunotherapy?,"Since PD-L1 can also be found on the surface of normal cells throughout the body, the use of immunotherapies can cause side effects related to these normal cells also being attacked by the immune system. Some common side effects include tiredness (fatigue), loss of appetite, nausea, coughing, skin rash and itching. Always discuss treatment decisions with your oncologist and carefully weigh the risks and benefits of each treatment. For more details, read the American Cancer Society's article on Immune checkpoint inhibitors to treat cancer."
Is this test recommended for everyone with cancer?,"No. PD-L1 testing is only required or recommended for people who have certain types of cancers if they are being considered for treatment with PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibitors. This test is not used to screen for or diagnose cancer. If you are diagnosed with cancer, talk to your cancer specialist about what treatment options may be available for you."
How long will it take for the medicine to work?,"It may take several weeks to find the right dose, and even more time for your healthcare provider to know how well the medicine works to control your seizures. How long will this take depends on the conditions of each person. It may require 14-21 days to achieve the steady therapeutic blood level. Factors affecting dose optimization include how often you have seizures, what other medicines you may be taking, and how your body responds to phenobarbital."
How long will my phenobarbital level have to be monitored?,"In general, your levels will need to be monitored as long as you are taking the medication. Phenobarbital, like other anti-epileptic drugs, is usually taken every day (sometimes several times a day) for your lifetime. Exceptions to this may be adults who have outgrown their epileptic syndromes from childhood or people whose seizures are caused by a temporary condition and only need the medication for a limited time."
Will phenobarbital affect other medicines that I am taking?,"It might. Be sure to tell your healthcare providers the names of all prescription medicines, herbal or dietary supplements, vitamins, and over-the-counter medicines you take. Some of these may interfere with how phenobarbital works, lowering or raising the level in your blood. Phenobarbital may also affect how other medicines work."
I am taking the drug primidone. Why is my doctor monitoring phenobarbital?,"Primidone is another medication that is used to control seizures. Phenobarbital is the major breakdown product (metabolite) of primidone that is also active in controlling seizures. To ensure that there is enough active drug in your blood to control your symptoms without causing toxicity, your healthcare provider may monitor phenobarbital when you are prescribed primidone."
"If there are no symptoms, how will I know if I have an abnormal phosphorus level?","Abnormal phosphorus levels are usually detected because of the relationship with and effect on calcium levels. Calcium is routinely tested as part of the comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) and basic metabolic panel (BMP), tests that are frequently ordered as part of a health exam. If you have an abnormal calcium level, your healthcare provider usually will check your phosphorus level."
Can vegetarians meet their phosphorus needs without resorting to meat or dairy?,"Yes, but only about 50% of the phosphorus in plant sources such as beans, lentils, grains, peanuts and almonds is available to the body because we lack the enzymes to process it. An exception to this is yeast breads because yeast provides the necessary enzyme."
Can I have more than one pheochromocytoma at once?,"Yes. Usually a single adrenal tumor will arise in one gland or the other, but multiple tumors can form. This is more likely in people with a strong family history of pheochromocytomas. You may have a tumor in each adrenal gland or occasionally in other locations."
Does the amount of plasma free metanephrines detected correspond to the size of the tumor?,"No, it has more to do with the characteristics of the tumor. Even a very small tumor can produce large amounts of catecholamines."
Is it really necessary to follow the dietary restrictions?,"The level of catecholamines (and their metabolites) in blood is affected by diet. For test accuracy, interfering substances need to be avoided. Various foods, including caffeine-containing foods such as coffee and energy drinks, and chocolate, as well as cigarette and cigar smoking may interfere with the test and should be avoided prior to testing. It is important to follow the instructions given by your healthcare provider and the specimen collecting site."
Is it really necessary to lie down before testing?,"You may be seated for the blood sample collection. However, recent guidelines suggest that it is preferable for the patient to be lying down. The healthcare provider or the collection site will instruct you as to their specific requirements."
My platelet count is low. How can I increase it?,"Generally, there are no lifestyle changes that you can make that would increase your platelet count. Treatment for a low platelet count usually involves addressing the underlying condition that is causing it. If your condition is mild and your platelet count is only slightly low, you may not require any treatment. If it is caused by a drug, your healthcare provider may switch you to a different one. If it is due to an autoimmune disorder, your healthcare practitioner may prescribe a drug that helps to suppress the immune system. People with platelet counts that are significantly decreased may be at risk for excessive bleeding and should be evaluated to determine the underlying cause and may require a platelet transfusion."
"If my platelet count is abnormal, what follow-up tests might my healthcare practitioner order? ","If the cause of the abnormal result is not apparent and cannot be determined from your medical history and physical examination, your healthcare provider may choose to order additional laboratory tests. Depending on the suspected cause and results from a CBC and blood smear examination, various follow-up tests may be performed. A few examples include:

CRP (preferred test) or ESR to detect inflammation
Tests for autoantibodies that target platelets (e.g., HIT antibody)
Tests for infectious diseases, including bacteria and viruses
Tests for bleeding disorders, such as PT, PTT, fibrinogen
Tests for kidney failure
Iron studies or vitamin B12 and folate levels
Tests for liver disease
In unexplained, serious cases, a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy"
Should everyone have platelet function tests?,"Many people will never need to have platelet function testing performed. It is generally only indicated when someone is experiencing bleeding, on specific medications, or having certain surgeries. The tests are not indicated for general screening."
Can my healthcare practitioner choose from a variety of platelet function tests?,"Typically, a hospital or laboratory will offer one or more tests but not a wide variety. Since the sample must be tested promptly, your healthcare practitioner will choose from what is available. Rarely, if a healthcare practitioner wanted a particular type of test done, then it might be necessary for you to go to a clinic, hospital, or another city where that test is performed."
Will my platelet function change over time?,"It could. While some conditions associated with platelet dysfunction are inherited, others are acquired and may occur at any point in your life. Platelet dysfunction that is due to a chronic disease may persist but can generally be managed. Dysfunction due to medication will typically resolve once the medication is discontinued."
Are there other genetic changes that my healthcare practitioner may test for with leukemia?,"Possibly. For example, the BCR-ABL fusion gene is a translocation genetic change that is associated with different chromosomes and different leukemias, namely chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)."
"If I have the PML-RARA gene, should my close family members be tested?",No. This genetic change is one that is acquired during a person's lifetime and is not inherited.
Should everyone with leukemia be tested?,Testing is only indicated when your healthcare practitioner suspects that you have APL or wants to rule it out. APL is a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The majority of people with leukemia will not have the PML-RARA gene sequence.
How long will it take for PML-RARA testing results?,That depends on the laboratory performing the testing. PML-RARA testing requires specialized equipment and expertise. It must be performed by a specialized hospital laboratory or a reference laboratory and it may take several days for results to be available.
Will latent porphyria affect my health?,"In most cases, the answer is no, and the porphyria will remain dormant. It is important, however, to have your latent porphyria identified if you have a family history so that your healthcare provider can tailor any medical treatments to avoid drugs and situations that might trigger signs and symptoms."
Can porphyrin tests be done at my healthcare practitioner's office?,"No. Porphyrin tests require specialized equipment and technical skills. Some tests may be performed in a local hospital laboratory, while others may need to be sent to a reference laboratory."
Why does the healthcare practitioner need a 24-hour urine sample if a random sample has already been tested?,"Random samples, which are collected at a single time point, are a useful way of screening for a porphyria. If the screening test is positive, a 24-hour urine sample is collected to give a more accurate measurement of how much porphyrin is excreted during one full day."
My mother was diagnosed as having porphyria many years ago but has not had any symptoms since then. Why is this?,It may be that her disease has been quiet all this time. It is also possible that the diagnosis made back then was incorrect. Testing for porphyria many years ago was not as accurate and some people may have been diagnosed incorrectly.
"When I look on the Internet for information about safe and unsafe drugs, different sites use different classifications and the lists are not the same. Why is this?","Information on the safety of drugs in porphyria is incomplete. Porphyria is a rare disease and many new drugs have been introduced in recent years. Thus, it is often not possible to be sure that a drug is safe until it has been used safely in many patients with porphyria, and this may take years to establish."
My potassium level is only slightly out of range. What does this mean?,"Your potassium result is interpreted by your healthcare practitioner within the context of other tests that you have had done as well as other factors, such as your medical history. A single high or low result may or may not have medical significance. Generally, this is the case when the test value is only slightly higher or lower than the reference range. This is why healthcare practitioners may repeat a test on you and why they may look at results from prior times when you had the same test performed.
On the other hand, a result outside the range may indicate a problem and warrant further investigation. Your healthcare practitioner will evaluate your test results and determine whether a result that falls outside of the reference range means something significant for you."
What are some good dietary sources of potassium?,"Foods high in potassium include many fruits and vegetables, such as bananas, cantaloupe, grapefruit, oranges, tomatoes, honeydew melons, squash, and potatoes. Other foods such as legumes, nuts, and seeds are good sources of potassium too."
Is there a home test I can use to check my potassium level?,No. Electrolyte tests are performed by trained personnel using sophisticated instruments.
"What is the difference between prealbumin, serum/plasma albumin, and urine albumin tests?","Although the names are similar, prealbumin and albumin are completely different molecules. They are both proteins made by the liver, however, and both have been used historically to evaluate nutritional status. Serum/plasma (or blood) albumin is now more often used to screen for and help diagnose liver or kidney disease and is tested on a blood sample. The urine albumin test (in the past, called a microalbumin test) detects and measures albumin in the urine as an early indicator of kidney damage."
What can cause a false-negative urine hCG?,Urine hCG tests may give a false-negative result if the urine is too diluted or if testing is done too soon in the pregnancy. Certain drugs such as diuretics  and promethazine (an antihistamine) may cause false-negative urine results.
What can cause a false-positive result?,"Drugs such as antihistamines, anti-anxiety medications, diuretics, anti-convulsants, anti-parkinson drugs, hypnotics, and tranquilizers may cause false-positive results.
The presence of protein in the urine (proteinuria), blood in the urine (hematuria), or excess pituitary gonadotropin may also cause a false-positive urine hCG test.
There are reports of false-positive blood hCG results due to the presence of certain types of antibodies that some individuals produce or fragments of the hCG molecule. Generally, if results are questionable, they may be confirmed by testing with a different method."
How does the test that I do at home myself compare with the results of a test done in a lab?,"Home pregnancy testing is very similar to qualitative urine hCG testing performed in the laboratory, but there are factors surrounding its use that are important to note.

Home tests come with very specific directions that must be followed explicitly. If you are using a home test, follow the directions extremely carefully (see Home Testing). There can be variability in sensitivity to detecting the presence of hCG with different brands of home pregnancy kits.
Home tests are sometimes done too soon after the missed menstrual cycle to result in a positive test. It typically takes 10 days after a missed menstrual period before the presence of hCG can be detected by the urine test.
All urine hCG tests should be done on a first morning urine sample, if possible. Urine becomes more dilute after ingestion of liquids (coffee, juice, water, etc.) and urine hCG concentrations may become too low to register as positive.

Generally, when used correctly, the home test should produce the same result as the urine hCG test done by your healthcare practitioner. Blood testing for hCG is more sensitive than urine hCG testing, so sometimes a blood test will indicate pregnancy when the urine test is negative."
When is a blood hCG test ordered instead of a urine hCG?,"Since hCG is not normally detected in the urine of a non-pregnant woman, a urine hCG is enough to confirm a pregnancy. This can also be done with a qualitative blood hCG test. Sometimes, however, it is important to know how much hCG is present to evaluate a suspected ectopic pregnancy or to monitor a woman following a miscarriage. In these circumstances, a healthcare practitioner will order a quantitative blood hCG test."
How many days after a miscarriage would it take for a urine pregnancy test to show a negative result?,"Urine hCG decreases at about the same rate as serum hCG, which can take anywhere from 9 to 35 days, with a median of 19 days. However, the timeframe for when an hCG result will be negative is dependent on what the hCG level was at the time of the miscarriage. Frequently, miscarriages are monitored with quantitative blood hCG testing. If the levels of hCG do not fall to undetectable levels, some hCG-producing tissue may remain and have to be removed."
Is GBS considered a sexually transmitted disease (STD)?,No. It is a common bacterium that colonizes both men and women and is not considered an STD.
Can babies get GBS infections more than 7 days after they are born?,Infants can also contract late-onset GBS infection from 7 days to several months after birth. Late-onset disease is not preventable by administering antibiotics during labor since the bacteria are not acquired during pregnancy or during the birth process.
What is the difference between group A and group B streptococcus?,"Group A streptococcus (GAS) and group B streptococcus (GBS) are similar types of bacteria, but they cause different types of infections. Group A strep is not usually part of the normal bacterial flora. It is the bacteria that causes ""strep throat"" that is detected using a rapid strep test or a throat culture. Group A strep may also cause severe skin and wound infections. Group B strep can be part of the normal bacteria found in the throat, vaginal tract, and digestive tract. GBS causes infections in newborns and in adults with weakened immune systems."
Does GBS cause serious infections in adults?,"Yes. Although GBS usually does not cause illness in healthy adults, it may cause infections of the lining of the uterus (endometritis) in women who have given birth (postpartum) or who have undergone other obstetric or gynecological procedures. GBS also causes wound infections and serious blood and central nervous system infections in adults, especially in those who have diabetes.
GBS can also cause skin infections, pneumonia, septicemia and urinary tract infections (UTI) in the elderly and those with underlying health conditions and/or weakened immune systems, congestive heart failure, vascular disease, liver disease, heart disease, AIDS, or cancer.
General screening of asymptomatic people, as it is discussed in this article, is not performed in these populations. Cultures of the affected areas of the body are done only if signs and symptoms of infection are present."
Who is at risk of sepsis?,"Sepsis is more common in newborns, infants, and in the elderly, but other people at risk include post-surgery patients, people with internal medical devices such as catheters, people with chronic conditions such as diabetes, and people with weakened immune systems. Though less common, even healthy children and adults can develop sepsis from an infection that can progress if not recognized early and treated."
What types of infections can lead to sepsis?,"Infections that most commonly lead to sepsis include those of the lung (pneumonia), urinary tract, skin, and digestive tract. Common bacteria that can trigger sepsis include Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli (E. coli), and some types of Streptococcus."
What other tests may be done if a systemic bacterial infection or sepsis is suspected?,"Other tests may include cultures (e.g., blood culture, urine culture or cultures of other body fluids), complete blood count (CBC), lactate, blood gases, comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), prothrombin time (PT) and/or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and C-reactive protein (CRP). To learn more, see the Sepsis article."
Are men tested for progesterone?,"While men have small amounts of progesterone in their blood, progesterone is usually not tested in men, unless specific adrenal diseases are suspected. Progesterone does not have an established role in males."
Is progesterone used as treatment?,"Yes. Progesterone (in the synthetic form progestin) is often used in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopausal women who still have their uterus and is used in some contraceptive pills. (For more information on the benefits and risks of HRT, talk to your health practitioner and see the related websites under Related Content below.)"
"If I am menopausal and on hormone replacement therapy (HRT), is there ever a need to monitor my progesterone level?","Sometimes. If you still have your uterus and are having symptoms, such as unexplained uterine bleeding, your healthcare practitioner may order a progesterone test along with other tests and procedures. If you do not have a uterus (removed during a hysterectomy), your HRT will not include progesterone and it will not need to be checked."
What other tests may be done to evaluate an elevated prolactin?,"Depending on the purpose of testing, other tests that may be done include:

Testosterone—levels will usually be low in a male when prolactin is high
Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH)—to help evaluate ovulation and fertility
An MRI of the brain—to show pituitary enlargement and help locate a tumor
An eye examination—to evaluate problems with vision

Elevated prolactin levels require further laboratory tests to ensure that the elevation is not due to macroprolactin (see below)."
"If I have an elevated prolactin, why is my healthcare practitioner testing my thyroid?","Increased levels of prolactin are often seen in people with hypothyroidism (although they do not cause it). If you have elevated prolactin, your healthcare practitioner will most likely test you for hypothyroidism."
Will PSA testing detect all prostate cancers?,No. Sometimes cancer cells do not produce much PSA and the test will be negative even when the disease is present.
What are some other tests that may be done when the PSA level is only slightly elevated to help decide whether a prostate cancer is present?,"Although PSA can help detect cancer, there are sometimes false-positive results, especially when the PSA is only slightly elevated. Biopsies used in follow-up to positive PSA results can cause discomfort, anxiety, and sometimes complications. As these tests becomes more widely available, they may aid some men and their healthcare practitioners in decisions about their future care:

PCA3—PCA3 is a protein produced only in the prostate gland. The test measures the urine level of PCA3 messenger RNA (m-RNA), a signal from genes that tells the prostate to produce the PCA3 protein. Increased amounts of the m-RNA (over-expressed) are produced by 95% of prostate cancer cells, so an elevated level may help to indicate that a prostate cancer is present.
[-2] proPSA—this test looks for a precursor of PSA, which may be produced by prostate cancer cells at a higher rate than benign prostate cells. The percentage of [-2] proPSA relative to the total PSA level has been used, like the % free PSA, to help decide whether a biopsy is indicated.
TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion—this test is also a urine-based assay that detects mRNA that is the result of a gene rearrangement. The gene rearrangement is over-expressed in more than 50% of prostate cancers, so an elevated level may help to indicate that a prostate cancer is present.

These tests do not provide a definitive answer as to whether you have a prostate cancer or not. A positive biopsy remains the gold standard in diagnosing prostate cancer. Rather, they are intended to help predict whether a biopsy would be useful in helping to establish a diagnosis."
What are some tests that may be done to help decide whether a prostate cancer is likely to be fast-growing and spread (metastasize) and therefore should be removed rather than watched?,"Gleason scoring—this refers to a part of the pathologist's report after reviewing the biopsy of the prostate that describes the degree to which certain features of prostate cancer known to be associated with a poor prognosis are present in the patient's cancer.
Prostate gene expression profile—this is a test in which the prostate cancer in the biopsy is analyzed using genetic techniques to determine the degree of activation of certain genes known to be associated with poor prognosis.
TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion—this urine test, sometimes used to help determine if a biopsy is needed, has also been shown to help predict how the cancer will behave.

Although Gleason scoring is performed on all new prostate cancers discovered by biopsy, the other tests are still undergoing study. It is fair to say that there is no easy way to determine whether a prostate cancer will spread and grow quickly or will be a slow-growing cancer unlikely to cause the person's death. This makes the decision to undergo PSA testing and, if PSA is elevated, prostate biopsy, an important one."
What other tests might be ordered?,"A healthcare practitioner will also likely order other tests to look for underlying diseases or conditions, such as liver disease, vitamin K deficiency, or cancer, that may cause inappropriate blood clotting (bleeding or thrombosis). Examples of other tests that may be used to investigate excessive clotting include:

Antithrombin
Lupus anticoagulant and other antiphospholipid antibodies—to help diagnose antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)
Factor V Leiden and prothrombin (factor II) 20210 mutation—to detect inherited risk factors (may not be done with the first DVT but may be used if you have a recurrent blood clot)"
I am on anticoagulant therapy. Can I still have this test done?,"If you are on anticoagulation therapy, your healthcare provider may need to consult an expert on coagulation testing and decide if the protein C and/or protein S activity assay can be reliably performed and interpreted. Anticoagulant drugs may either alter protein C and protein S levels or interfere with the protein C and protein S activity assays; therefore, the treatment may have to be stopped for a period of time before blood samples are collected for the tests."
Is there anything I can do to increase protein C and protein S levels?,"Not directly. If you have deficiencies that are due to a temporary condition (such as pregnancy or an infection), they should return to normal levels by themselves. If they are due to an underlying condition, like liver disease or vitamin K deficiency, then that condition must be addressed. If you have inherited protein C or protein S deficiencies or dysfunction, your healthcare provider will often advise you to concentrate on lowering other clotting risk factors. This may include not smoking and avoiding oral contraceptive use."
Should relatives of someone with an inherited protein C or protein S deficiency be tested?,"Not necessarily. Routine screening has not been recommended because the penetrance of the genes is low. This means that even if you have the genetic change, you may or may not ever have a clotting problem. Your healthcare provider may want to order this testing, however, if you have a strong family history of a severe protein C or protein S deficiency or a history of developing a thrombosis at an early age."
What are free light chains and how are they related to immunoglobulins?,"Immunoglobulins are part of the body’s natural defense system and are produced by plasma cells in the bone marrow. They are composed of four protein chains–two identical heavy (long) protein chains and two identical light (shorter) protein chains.

The heavy chains may consist of one of five different types. The five major classes of immunoglobulins, defined by the type of heavy protein chains in their structure, are IgG, Ig A, IgM, IgD, and IgE.
The light chains consist of one of two different types called kappa and lambda.

Within a plasma cell, two heavy chains of one type and two light chains of one type become attached to form one intact immunoglobulin molecule. Each particular plasma cell will produce only one type of immunoglobulin. These chains that are used to form the immunoglobulins are said to be ""immunoglobulin-bound."" Normally, there is a slight excess of kappa and lambda light chains produced (free light chains).
However, in diseases such as in multiple myeloma, the plasma cells may produce excessive or mutated light chains that do not associate with heavy chains. These abnormal free light chains can be detected with a free light chain test. The ratios between the kappa and lambda free light chains also can be evaluated. An abnormal ratio and increased levels of one serum free light chain are often associated with diseases. For more information, see the article on Serum Free Light Chains."
What are Bence Jones proteins?,They are free immunoglobulin light chains that are found in the urine. These free light chains can be caused by certain forms of multiple myeloma.
"If I have an abnormal monoclonal immunoglobulin in my blood, does it mean that I have multiple myeloma or some other type of cancer?","Not necessarily. Monoclonal protein production may be due to a condition known as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Most people with MGUS initially have a benign course but may progress to a more serious condition. They must continue to be monitored regularly with a serum protein electrophoresis test, or sometimes a free light chain test, depending on which monoclonal protein is being produced. MGUS is present in about 4% of Caucasians over the age of 50 and progresses at a rate of 1% per year to multiple myeloma."
Is electrophoresis used for anything else?,"Yes, it may be used any time a separation of molecules is desired. Hemoglobin electrophoresis, for instance, is used to help detect abnormal forms of hemoglobin, such as HbS variant that cause sickle cell anemia or in various forms of thalassemia. Electrophoresis is also used in certain circumstances to separate different forms of enzymes, called isoenzymes, lipoproteins (e.g., LDL, HDL) or DNA and RNA fragments. These are only a few examples of electrophoresis applications in clinical laboratories and research."
Can I do this test at home?,"Yes, if you will be taking warfarin for an extended period of time. The Food and Drug Administration has approved several home PT and INR testing systems. However, home testing is usually done in the context of a home-based coagulation management program that involves patient training and defined response and management protocols. For more details, see the article on Home Testing."
What food and medications can affect PT and INR results?,"Some antibiotics can increase the PT and INR. Barbiturates, oral contraceptives and hormone-replacement therapy (HRT), and vitamin K (either in a multivitamin or liquid nutrition supplement) may decrease PT.
Drinking alcohol can also affect PT results. Certain foods, such as beef and pork liver, green tea, broccoli, chickpeas, kale, turnip greens, and soybean products, contain large amounts of vitamin K and can alter PT results. It is important that a healthcare provider knows about all of the drugs, supplements, and foods that you have consumed recently so that the PT and INR results are interpreted and used correctly."
I am being treated with warfarin (Coumadin®). Should I avoid eating foods that are rich in vitamin K and will limiting these foods cause an increased risk of vitamin K deficiency?,"Warfarin works by reducing the available vitamin K for the liver to make several of the blood clotting factors. Thus, warfarin and vitamin K are antagonists—they work against each other. Significant increases or decreases in the amount of vitamin K a person consumes can affect how well that person's dose of warfarin works in preventing blood clots without causing excess bleeding. So rather than avoiding foods rich in vitamin K, it is more important for you to consume a consistent amount of those foods each day. You can get the vitamin K you need as long as you are consistent about the amount you consume."
Should I have a PT done at the same time of day?,"It is not generally necessary to have your PT and INR measured at a particular time of day. It is, however, important that you take your warfarin medication at the same time each day to maintain a continuous level. If your healthcare provider increases or decreases your dose, your provider may want you to have your blood rechecked within a few days to judge the effect of the dosage change on your PT/INR (it is not an immediate effect)."
"My PT/INR results vary sometimes, yet my doctor doesn’t change my prescription. Why?","Illness, change in diet, and some medications (as mentioned above) can alter PT/INR results. Certain foods, such as beef and pork liver, green tea, broccoli, chickpeas, kale, turnip greens, and soybean products contain large amounts of vitamin K and can alter PT/INR results. The blood collection technique and the difficulty in obtaining the blood sample can also affect test results. If your healthcare provider has concerns about the stability of your PT/INR, your provider may test your blood more frequently before adjusting your dose."
Can this test be done at my local laboratory?,"The PSEN1 test is a relatively new test that has limited use and is still rarely ordered. It is performed in only a few laboratories, so if a healthcare practitioner recommends the test, the blood sample will need to be sent to a reference laboratory."
My father has been diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer disease. Can my doctor tell if my father has a genetic mutation without a blood test?,"No, the clinical symptoms of all forms of AD are often the same. They only differ by age of onset. You cannot tell whether someone has an inherited form of AD just by looking examining them. If there is a strong family history of early onset AD, especially if another family member has had positive genetic testing, your doctor may suspect a genetic problem that may be confirmed by a blood test."
Are there any other genetic tests that will diagnose AD?,"The other genes that have mutations associated with EOFAD are PSEN2 and APP (amyloid precursor protein). Testing is available, but these are less frequent causes of EOFAD."
My RBC count is slightly out of range. What does this mean?,"Your RBC count is interpreted by your healthcare practitioner within the context of other tests that you have had done as well as other factors, such as your medical history. A single result that is slightly high or low may or may not have medical significance. There are several reasons why a test result may differ on different days and why it may fall outside a designated reference range.

Biological variability (different results in the same person at different times): If you have the same test done on several different occasions, there's a good chance that one result will fall outside a reference range even though you are in good health. For biological reasons, your values can vary from day to day.
Individual variability (differences in results between different people): References ranges are usually established by collecting results from a large population and determining from the data an expected average result and expected differences from that average (standard deviation). There are individuals who are healthy but whose tests results, which are normal for them, do not always fall within the expected range of the overall population.

A test value that falls outside of the established reference range supplied by the laboratory may mean nothing significant. Generally, this is the case when the test value is only slightly higher or lower than the reference range and this is why a healthcare practitioner may repeat a test on you and why they may look at results from prior times when you had the same test performed.
However, a result outside the range may indicate a problem and warrant further investigation. Your healthcare provider will consider your medical history, physical exam, and other relevant factors to determine whether a result that falls outside of the reference range means something significant for you. For more, read the articles on Reference Ranges and What They Mean."
"If my RBC Count is out of range, what other tests might be done?","An RBC count can be used to detect a problem with red blood cell production and/or lifespan, but it cannot determine the underlying cause. In addition to the full CBC, some other tests may be performed at the same time or as follow up to help establish a diagnosis. Examples include:

Blood smear—a laboratory professional examines the blood under the microscope to confirm results of a CBC and/or to look abnormal blood cells
Reticulocyte count—determines the number of young (immature) red blood cells
Iron studies—iron is important in the production of red blood cells
Vitamin B12 and folate levels—these vitamins are also important for red blood cell production
In more severe conditions, a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy—usually done by a pathologist to help detect abnormalities in the bone marrow and determine the cause of low or high blood cell counts or abnormal blood cells"
How treatable are abnormal red blood cell counts?,"First, a healthcare practitioner must determine the cause of someone's abnormal RBC count so the appropriate treatment can be prescribed. For some anemias, treatment may include a dietary supplement or a change in diet to include nutritional foods. In some instances, it may only require a change in the person's current medication. For more severe cases, treatment may involve transfusion with blood from a donor. For some, prescribing a drug to stimulate red cell production in the bone marrow may be required, especially for people who have received chemotherapy or radiation treatments."
Can my RBC count be tested at my doctor’s office?,Maybe. Some healthcare practitioners' offices are equipped with laboratory instruments and staffed by trained laboratorians who are able to perform this test.
Do diet and nutrition help keep RBCs at healthy levels?,"Yes, to the extent that if you eat a well-balanced diet, you can prevent anemia due to a lack of iron, vitamin B12, or folate in the foods you eat. Sometimes use of a supplement is recommended if you are at risk of a vitamin deficiency. However, the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency is malabsorption, and the most common cause of iron deficiency is bleeding. These conditions and other RBC problems that are caused by diseases other than nutritional deficiencies will not be corrected by diet."
Are there symptoms I should recognize if my RBCs are dangerously low or high?,"Fatigue and weakness may indicate a low or high RBC count. Fainting, pallor, shortness of breath, dizziness, and/or altered mental status can also indicate a low RBC count. Disturbed vision, headache, and flushing may be present with increased numbers of RBCs."
Should everyone have an RBC antibody screen performed?,"It is not necessary unless someone is pregnant or may need a transfusion. RBC antibodies do not otherwise affect the health of someone who has them. Sometimes a healthcare practitioner may test a woman after a pregnancy, especially if her baby had complications, to determine if there may be risks associated with a future pregnancy. Also, a healthcare practitioner may order a direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and RBC antibody screen if hemolysis or anemia due to autoantibodies is suspected."
Do RBC antibodies go away?,"No. They may drop to low levels in the blood but once you have developed them, the cells that make them remain in your body and the antibody level may increase significantly again with repeated exposure to the same RBC antigen. You should always get blood that is negative for the corresponding antigens to clinically significant antibodies."
Do RBC antibodies affect blood donation?,"They do not affect the safety of the person donating and will not affect the processing of red blood cells for transfusion. If someone has potent RBC antibodies in their plasma, however, then that plasma may not be acceptable for all transfusions."
What happened before the RhIg (Rh immune globulin) injection was developed?,"Prior to development of the injection, Rh-negative mothers would often become sensitized from the blood of their first Rh-positive baby and begin developing anti-Rh antibodies. Any subsequent Rh-positive babies would have some degree of Rh disease, due to the mother's anti-Rh antibodies attacking the baby's RBCs. Miscarriages and stillborn babies were relatively common, and those babies who were born often needed immediate blood transfusions to survive. The immune globulin injection has largely prevented these complications, although a small percent of women do still develop Rh antibodies."
I’m blood type O. Do I have a chance of having a baby with ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn?,"Yes. Hemolytic disease of the newborn may occur when there is an ABO incompatibility between mother and baby, especially with mothers who are blood group O. However, the RBC antibody screen is not useful in this situation because our bodies naturally produce antibodies against the A and B antigens we do not have on our red blood cells. A mother who is blood type A will naturally have antibodies directed against the B surface antigens on red blood cells, and a mother who is type B will have anti-A antibodies, and so on. Generally, this is a mild form that is easily treatable."
Can I get antibodies from donating blood?,"No, you will not be exposed to anyone else's blood while donating."
One of the results from my renal panel is slightly out of range. What does this mean?,"The results of your renal panel are interpreted by your healthcare provider within the context of other tests that you have had done as well as other factors, such as your medical history. A single result that is slightly high or low may or may not have medical significance. There are several reasons why a test result may differ on different days and why it may fall outside a designated reference range.

Biological variability (different results in the same person at different times): If a healthcare practitioner runs the same test on you on several different occasions, there's a good chance that one result will fall outside a reference range even though you are in good health. For biological reasons, your values can vary from day to day.
Individual variability (differences in results between different people): Reference ranges are usually established by collecting results from a large population and determining from the data an expected average (mean) result and expected differences from that average (standard deviation). There are individuals who are healthy but whose tests results, which are normal for them, do not always fall within the expected range of the overall population.


Thus, a test value that falls outside of the established reference range supplied by the laboratory may mean nothing significant. Generally, this is the case when the test value is only slightly higher or lower than the reference range and this is why a healthcare practitioner may repeat a test on you and may look at results from prior times when you had the same test performed.
However, a result outside the range may indicate a problem and warrant further investigation. Your healthcare provider will evaluate your test results in the context of your medical history, physical examination, and other relevant factors to determine whether a result that falls outside of the reference range means something significant for you.
For more, read the articles on Reference Ranges and What They Mean and How Reliable is Laboratory Testing?"
Will these tests always be run as a panel?,"No, each test that is usually included in a renal panel may be run independently or along with different tests, depending on the purpose of the testing. For example, the electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate) may be run as an electrolyte panel as part of a routine health screen or to detect a potential problem with someone's fluid or acid-base balance, which could be caused by heart disease, for example. The glucose test is also commonly performed to screen for, diagnose, and monitor diabetes."
What other tests besides those included in a renal panel might be ordered to assess kidney function?,"Other laboratory tests that can be used to assess kidney function include:

Urinalysis
Urine protein
Creatinine clearance


For people with diabetes or high blood pressure (hypertension), a urine albumin (microalbumin) test, which measures small amounts of albumin leakage from the blood into the urine, may also be used to detect early kidney damage. When both albumin and creatinine are measured in a random urine sample, an albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) can be calculated. This may be done to more accurately determine how much albumin is escaping from the kidneys into the urine.
The National Kidney Foundation (NKF) and the National Kidney Disease Education Program (NKEDP) recommend two tests, in addition to blood pressure measurement, to screen for kidney disease in people with increased risk: urine protein (either urine albumin, urinalysis or urine total protein) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
When a structural problem is suspected, a variety of imaging tests can be used to evaluate the kidneys. A sample of kidney tissue, a biopsy, is sometimes helpful in diagnosing the specific cause of the problem. For more information, see the article on Kidney Disease."
Can I have kidney disease if I feel fine?,"Yes. Kidney disease often does not cause noticeable symptoms until late in the disease. That is why it is important, especially for those with risk factors for kidney disease, to have regular health exams so that any disorders or diseases that may affect the kidneys can be promptly addressed."
Can I have abnormal test results and not have kidney disease?,"Yes. Since the tests included in the renal panel can have broad applications, abnormal results on one or more of the tests could indicate a problem other than kidney disease. Your healthcare provider will interpret the results of your renal panel tests by looking at all of your results, along with the results of any other tests you had performed as well as your symptoms, exam findings, and medical and family history."
"Like a flu test or strep test, can this test be performed in my healthcare practitioner's office?","In general, no. It requires specialized equipment and expertise. It may be performed in a local laboratory if it is offered or may need to be sent to a reference laboratory. Individual molecular tests are, however, becoming increasingly available in some healthcare practitioners' offices."
What are some traditional tests for respiratory infections?,"Traditional testing has included viral or bacterial cultures or testing for the viruses or bacteria one at a time (and sometimes needing multiple samples) using rapid tests and antigen tests. These tests are useful, but some bacteria can be hard to grow successfully in culture, and viral cultures are not routinely available in most clinical laboratories. Many of these tests are also labor-intensive, and it may take 2-3 days or more for results. The rapid tests and antigen tests are quicker, but they may not be as good at detecting infections as molecular methods. Many laboratories are adopting molecular tests that detect genetic material of microbes as the preferred way to diagnose a respiratory infection."
What other lab tests might be done?,"Since there are many causes of respiratory infections, and respiratory pathogen panels test for upper respiratory infections, they may be used in conjunction with other tests, such as a bacterial sputum culture, Gram stain, or sometimes a viral culture to help confirm a diagnosis and guide treatment decisions."
Why would my healthcare provider order additional tests?,"Additional testing may be done to confirm a positive result using another method, to perform susceptibility testing when the infection is caused by bacteria, or because the cause of your symptoms has not yet been identified."
Can I test negative and still have a respiratory infection?,"Yes. You can have an infection but a negative result if:

The test does not detect the virus or bacterial strain causing your infection
There was not enough genetic material in the sample to allow it to be detected
The microbe is a new strain that the test cannot reliably detect
Your sample was not properly collected"
Is there a blood test for RSV?,There are blood tests for RSV antibodies – the immune system's response to the virus. These tests are not routinely used to diagnose RSV infections but may be used by public health officials to track RSV infections.
Are antibiotics useful when I have RSV?,No. RSV is due to a virus – not bacteria – so antibiotic therapy is not indicated or helpful.
"In addition to a reticulocyte count, what other tests may be done?","Several other tests may be used in conjunction with a reticulocyte count to further evaluate someone for a condition affecting RBC production. Some examples include:

Iron studies
Vitamin B12 and Folate
Haptoglobin
G6PD
Erythropoietin

Sometimes a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy may be done in follow up to abnormal results on initial tests. This procedure is invasive and can not be performed on everyone. It can, however, provide additional information, if necessary."
Can the reticulocyte count be done on the same tube of blood as the RBC count or CBC?,"Yes. If anemia is detected during a routine blood test, the healthcare practitioner may order additional testing (including a reticulocyte count) on the same tube of blood if it can be done on the same day."
Will a blood transfusion affect reticulocyte results?,Yes. Your healthcare provider will determine how long you should wait after a transfusion before having a reticulocyte count performed.
How else might my doctor evaluate the cell production in my bone marrow?,"In some cases, a procedure called a bone marrow aspiration may be performed to obtain a sample of marrow to evaluate under the microscope. Sometimes this is the best way for a healthcare provider to determine how well the bone marrow is functioning."
What are the recommendations for rubella vaccination?,"The rubella vaccine is contained in a combination vaccine called MMR, which stands for measles, mumps and rubella. Since all three of these are common viral illnesses, they are contained within one vaccine. Measles is also known as rubeola and is different from Rubella (German Measles). All children should receive two doses of MMR, the first dose at 12-15 months of age and the second dose at 4-6 years of age."
Should pregnant women be vaccinated for rubella?,"The rubella vaccine should not be given to a pregnant woman, and a woman should avoid getting pregnant for at least one month after getting vaccinated."
Does the vaccine have any risks?,"The vaccine contains a live virus that has been altered so it promotes an antibody response but does not cause a rubella infection. Some people may have a rash that lasts 2-3 weeks after vaccination and pain in their joints, especially their hands and wrists. Side effects are rarely seen in young children who get the vaccine. People who have suppressed immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS and those with cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy, should consult with their healthcare providers before getting a rubella vaccine."
How soon after exposure to the virus do symptoms appear?,"Symptoms are not always noticeable, but if they do appear, the rash usually begins 12-23 days after coming in contact with an infectious person. A person is usually infectious about a week before the rash is visible and for 1-2 weeks afterwards. A newborn who was infected during pregnancy may remain infectious for several months."
What other tests might be ordered in emergency or overdose cases?,"In emergency situations, a salicylate test may be ordered with other tests, such as:

Arterial blood gases and electrolytes to evaluate oxygenation and acid-base balance
Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine to evaluate kidney function
Urinalysis to monitor urine pH
Glucose to detect low blood sugar
Liver panel to evaluate liver function (AST, ALT)
Coagulation profile to assess blood clotting (PT, PTT, platelet count)"
Should everyone who takes aspirin regularly have a salicylate test performed?,"If you take occasional doses for pain, take only one low-dose tablet a day, or take moderate amounts of aspirin under the supervision of your healthcare provider and do not experience any side effects, then it is not typically necessary. Most people will not need to have this test performed unless they accidentally ingest significant quantities of aspirin or another salicylate, or if they develop side effects."
Will taking aspirin at normal dosage cause complications?,"Occasional use of aspirin for pain relief at recommended doses usually does not cause complications. It is possible that taking aspirin regularly at higher doses used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, for example, may cause symptoms and other complications, such as an increased risk of bleeding. You should only take aspirin on a regular basis (e.g., daily) under the supervision of a healthcare practitioner. Low-dose aspirin used to reduce the risk of heart attack is generally safe, but even this use should be discussed with a healthcare practitioner."
Why should aspirin not be given to children?,"An association has been found between the use of aspirin to treat the symptoms of flu-like viral illnesses such as the chickenpox and the development of Reye syndrome, a disease marked by acute brain damage and liver dysfunction that can be fatal. Aspirin should never be given to children unless directed by a healthcare practitioner. The National Reye's Syndrome Foundation, the U.S. Surgeon General, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Academy of Pediatrics all recommend against the use of aspirin or other products containing aspirin to treat fever-causing illnesses in children under the age of 19 years."
What proportion of infertility cases are caused by male fertility problems?,"About one-third of cases are due to men's problems with fertility, another third are due to women's problems, and the remaining cases are due to a combination of men's and women's infertility issues or have no clear identifiable reasons for infertility."
Is a home sperm count test available?,"Yes, there is a home test available that measures sperm count and gives a result within a few minutes. However, it is important to understand that a sperm count is only one part of a semen analysis for determination of male fertility and is only one aspect of a complex process. For more about home tests, including the benefits and cautions, see the article With Home Testing, Consumers Take Charge of Their Health."
What causes male infertility?,"Some of the common causes of male infertility include damage to the testicles from infections (such as mumps), chemotherapy/radiation, trauma or surgery, obstruction of the tubes that carry semen to the penis caused by scarring from an infection or having cystic fibrosis, a varicocele (an enlarged collection of blood vessels in the scrotum that raises the temperature of the testicles, which can lead to low sperm production), having the genetic condition Klinefelter syndrome, and anything that lowers levels of the hormones LH and FSH, such as a pituitary tumor. Chronic illness, poor overall health, obesity, certain medications, and drug abuse may also decrease sperm production and fertility."
What drugs can affect the serotonin test?,"There are a variety of drugs that can affect the serotonin test, including morphine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (such as reserpine), methyldopa, and lithium. You should talk to your healthcare provider before decreasing or discontinuing any medications."
Should I have both the serotonin and 5-HIAA tests performed?,"Serotonin and 5-HIAA offer complementary information. In some cases, 5-HIAA is preferred because it is more stable and, since it is collected for 24 hours, there is more chance of detecting increased 5-HIAA than in identifying excess serotonin that is only released intermittently. Talk to your healthcare practitioner about which tests are appropriate for your condition. "
Are some people at a higher risk for developing a carcinoid tumor?,"Anyone at any age can develop a carcinoid tumor but, according to the American Cancer Society, the average age at diagnosis is the early 60s for GI carcinoid tumors and between age 45 and 55 for lung carcinoid tumors. If you have a family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN1), a genetic condition that increases a person's risk of developing tumors in the endocrine system glands, you may be at higher risk for developing a carcinoid tumor."
How does a healthcare practitioner locate the carcinoid tumor?,"This is usually accomplished through the use of imaging scans such as x-rays, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In some cases, surgery is required to find the tumor. For more on these imaging tests, visit RadiologyInfo.org."
How does my healthcare practitioner tell whether a tumor is benign or cancerous?,"In order to determine whether the tumor is benign or cancerous, your healthcare practitioner will need to perform a biopsy or remove the tumor surgically. The tumor is sent to the laboratory and a pathologist will examine the tumor cells using a microscope. (For more, see the article on Anatomic Pathology.)"
Should everyone have a serum free light chain test?,No. This test is not intended to be a screen for the general public. It may be useful as part of the evaluation of certain individuals with unexplained signs or symptoms that could be due to a plasma cell disorder.
"Why would my healthcare practitioner order a ""baseline"" serum free light chain test?","If you have monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or are diagnosed with another plasma cell disorder (dyscrasia), then a serum free light chain test and ratio done when you are diagnosed and/or prior to any treatment can be used to compare with subsequent testing to help assess disease progression or response to treatment."
Can serum free light chain testing be done at home or in my healthcare practitioner's office?,No. This test is not available for home testing. It requires specialized equipment and is usually performed in a laboratory. Your sample may need to be sent to a reference laboratory.
Are there other uses for the SHBG test?,"Not yet, but researchers are evaluating conditions in which there are changes in SHBG levels to see if there may be additional clinical uses for the test. Recent studies have identified that there may be a link between SHBG levels and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes."
How else might my health practitioner use the measurement of SHBG levels in my care?,"Having measured the total testosterone and SHBG levels, your healthcare practitioner or the laboratory can calculate the free testosterone level, which is one of the best measures of the active testosterone level in the plasma."
"In addition to SHBG, what other tests might be done?","Testing for the albumin level and one or more other sex hormones, such as prolactin, estradiol, LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle stimulating hormone), may also be performed to evaluate your existing balance of hormones."
Why aren't antibiotics a recommended treatment for an infection with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli ?,"If you are infected with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, antibiotics may increase your risk for developing hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)."
Why shouldn't I take anti-diarrheal medication if I have a Shiga toxin-producing E.coli infection of the gastrointestinal system?,Anti-diarrheal medicines may worsen or prolong your illness because they delay the removal of E. coli from your gastrointestinal tract by inhibiting the normal movement of food and fluids through the GI tract.
What else can cause acute diarrhea?,"Other bacteria that can cause acute diarrhea include:

Salmonella, often found in raw eggs, raw poultry, and in pet reptiles
Shigella, from fecally-contaminated food and water
Campylobacter, from raw or undercooked poultry
Clostridium difficile, may become overgrown in the gut after antibiotic use

Parasites can also cause diarrhea. They are found in lakes and streams throughout the world and may also contaminate swimming pools, hot tubs, and community water supplies. The most common single-celled parasites responsible for gastrointestinal illness in the U.S. are Giardia lamblia (giardia), Entamoeba histolytica (E. histolytica), and Cryptosporidium parvum (crypto).
Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe diarrhea among children. Other viruses that cause diarrhea include Norwalk, noroviruses (also called Norwalk-like viruses), adenoviruses, calciviruses, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and HIV."
Who is at risk for sickle cell disease?,"Anyone can inherit Hb S gene mutations, but sickle cell disease is more prevalent among those of African ancestry and those who can trace their roots to the Mediterranean area, South and Central America, the Middle East, India, and the Caribbean."
Why is this pattern of prevalence seen?,"It mirrors the areas of the world where malaria is found. Historically, sickle cell offered some protection and survival advantage against malaria. Since people from these areas have moved throughout the world, sickle cell gene mutations have become more widespread. A 2013 study noted that the rates of sickle cell anemia are increasing worldwide and are projected to affect more than 400,000 newborns by 2050, with India and sub-Saharan Africa showing the sharpest increases."
Why would an athlete be tested for sickle cell trait?,"Newborn screening identifies most cases of sickle cell trait and sickle cell anemia. However, this screening was not universally performed in the U.S. until relatively recently. Many adults, and especially athletes born in other countries, may not have been tested to determine their sickle cell status. Since there is some risk of ""exertional sickling"" during intense training, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) advocates testing college athletes who have not documented their sickle cell status."
Why would DNA sequencing be done as part of sickle cell testing?,"Your healthcare practitioner may request that DNA sequencing be done to help determine the types of abnormal hemoglobin that may be present. It is not routine testing but may be necessary if it is suspected that you have a less common form of hemoglobin (variant), such as hemoglobin F. Rather than testing for one specific gene mutation, DNA sequencing determines the order of DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in a person's genetic code. This method may be used to help identify hemoglobin disorders caused by less common mutations."
"Besides sirolimus testing, what other tests might be done and why?","Other tests may also be periodically ordered to evaluate organ function and blood cell counts because sirolimus may decrease a person's platelet count, white blood cell count, increase blood lipids, and, when taken long-term with other immunosuppressants, affect kidney function."
How long will I need to be on sirolimus?,"Transplant recipients must take immunosuppressants — including sirolimus or other drugs, often in combination — throughout their lives. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best choices for your condition; they may change over time."
Who orders sirolimus tests?,Sirolimus will usually be monitored by the healthcare provider and transplant team that performed your surgery or by a healthcare practitioner who has specific knowledge of transplantation and your condition.
Where are sirolimus tests performed?,"Sirolimus tests may be performed in a local hospital laboratory but may also be sent to a reference laboratory. Because different laboratories use different methods, each laboratory will have different reference ranges. Your healthcare provider will usually send your tests consistently to one laboratory for testing so that your levels can trend over time by the same testing method."
Is sirolimus given to patients who receive organs other than kidneys or have other conditions?,"Sirolimus also is used sometimes to treat psoriasis. Also, it was approved by the FDA in May 2015 for the treatment of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, a rare, progressive disease that affects the lungs, kidneys and the lymphatic system. This medication should not be given to prevent rejection of liver or lung transplants because it can cause serious and deadly side effects."
Should I tell my other healthcare providers that I am taking sirolimus?,"Yes. This is important information for them, partially because of drug interactions and partially because of the immunosuppressive action of sirolimus. Sirolimus can affect your ability to heal, to get vaccinations, and may increase the risk of developing certain cancers (such as skin cancers and lymphoma)."
Will smooth muscle antibody (SMA) ever go away?,"If it is due to a temporary condition, such as infectious mononucleosis, SMA may drop below detectable levels once the condition has resolved. If SMA is produced because of autoimmune hepatitis, then it will be present throughout a person's life, although levels may vary over time."
Can I have more than one cause of hepatitis?,"Yes. For instance, autoimmune hepatitis can co-exist with a viral hepatitis, such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C, and can be exacerbated by liver damage caused by alcohol abuse. Since the treatment of hepatitis depends on the cause, it is very important that your healthcare practitioner understand the underlying cause(s) of your condition."
How fast does autoimmune hepatitis progress?,"The course and severity of autoimmune hepatitis is hard to predict. It may be acute or chronic. Some people will have no or few symptoms for many years and are diagnosed when routine liver tests are abnormal. For more information, consult with your healthcare practitioner and see the links to other resources in the Related Pages section."
My sodium level is only slightly out of range. What does this mean?,"Your sodium result is interpreted by your healthcare practitioner within the context of other tests that you have had done as well as other factors, such as your medical history. A single high or low result may or may not have medical significance. Generally, this is the case when the test value is only slightly higher or lower than the reference range. This is why healthcare practitioners may repeat a test on you and why they may look at results from prior times when you had the same test performed.
On the other hand, a result outside the range may indicate a problem and warrant further investigation. Your healthcare practitioner will evaluate your test results and determine whether a result that falls outside of the reference range means something significant for you."
Is anyone at particular risk for low or high sodium levels?,"Yes. People who have long-lasting diarrhea and/or vomiting, profuse sweating, burns, Addison disease, kidney disease, or congestive heart failure may have low sodium levels. People with dehydration, diuretic use, Cushing syndrome, cystic fibrosis, neurological disorders, hypothyroidism, or renal failure may have high sodium levels."
Should athletes and others pay particular attention to re-hydrating after playing sports or exercising to keep their sodium levels up?,"Yes. During prolonged and strenuous exercise, both water and sodium are lost through sweating. To maintain the correct balance of water and sodium in the body, people may need not only to drink water but to ensure adequate sodium intake, whether through salty foods or specially formulated ""sports drinks."""
Should everyone have an SMRP test to screen for mesothelioma?,"The test is not intended for or useful as a general screening tool but only to help evaluate those who have already been diagnosed with mesothelioma. Since mesothelioma is a very rare cancer, most people will never need to have this test performed."
Can I have the SMRP test done in my healthcare provider's office?,"No, the test requires specialized equipment to perform and is not offered by most laboratories. In most cases, your blood will need to be sent to a reference laboratory."
Why not just order an iron test?,"A single iron test does not provide the full picture of the amount of iron that you have stored and available. It is usually necessary to evaluate the results of several related iron tests together. Ferritin is usually the preferred test to evaluate stored iron, but it is an acute phase reactant, meaning that it may be increased with inflammation or chronic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis patients who often have inflammation or infections, as well as people with diabetes who are treated with insulin. In these cases, ferritin may not be a good measure of stored iron as it may falsely indicate adequacy in iron reserve. The soluble transferrin receptor test is not a routinely order test, but since it is not an acute phase reactant, it may be ordered as an alternative to ferritin to evaluate stored iron when a chronic illness is present or suspected."
Can I have iron deficiency if I feel fine?,"Yes. Early deficiency usually will not cause any symptoms and when symptoms do emerge, they may be mild or nonspecific enough – such as fatigue – that they are attributed to something else."
How long does it take for results to become available?,Soluble transferrin receptor testing requires specialized equipment and is not offered by every laboratory. Your sample may be sent to a reference laboratory and it may take a few days for results to be available.
Why does my doctor want to send a second sTfR test to the same laboratory as the first test?,Test methods and reference (normal) ranges for sTfR will vary slightly from laboratory to laboratory. Your healthcare provider may prefer to send your samples to the same laboratory to make results more directly comparable.
Should I just take iron supplements?,"You should consult with your healthcare provider first. If you are anemic and/or at risk of anemia, then supplements may be useful. Excess iron in the body can cause health problems."
Why would my healthcare practitioner collect more than one sputum sample?,This may be done if the first sample is not considered adequate or if the healthcare practitioner wants to order additional tests on sputum samples.
Why would a separate test be ordered for fungus or an AFB smear and culture?,"These tests detect organisms that do not grow on nutrient media typically used for a routine bacterial sputum culture.  Fungus or mycobacterium species may take several weeks to grow in the laboratory, and they require the use of special stains to be detected under the microscope."
I have been sick for more than a week.  Why would my healthcare practitioner order a sputum culture now?,It may be that your healthcare practitioner suspects that you have developed a bacterial infection secondary to an initial viral infection or that your infection has not responded as expected to treatment.
"Once I have been treated for a bacterial lower respiratory tract infection, can the infection return?","For most people, once the infection has been successfully treated, it will not return. If the treatment was not successful, then the infection may persist or re-emerge. If someone has an underlying condition that increases their risk of lung infection, such as a lung disease, then they may experience recurrent (new) infections. In some cases, these recurrent infections can become increasingly challenging to treat."
What can I do to avoid getting a bacterial infection of the digestive tract?,"The best things to do are to not drink water or eat food that may be contaminated and to follow good sanitation practices, such as thorough and frequent hand washing. Food that might be contaminated, such as raw meats and eggs, should be cooked thoroughly. Cooked foods and foods that are served raw should not touch any surfaces that may have been contaminated. When you are traveling to developing nations, it is best to only drink bottled water, carbonated drinks, and hot cooked foods. Avoid fresh fruits and vegetables, limiting yourself to those that you can peel yourself. Avoid unpasteurized dairy products. Food from street vendors is generally not considered safe. If someone in your household has an infection that is causing diarrhea, careful hand washing by all family members is recommended, and the person infected should not prepare food or drink for others until the infection is resolved."
Why must the stool sample for culture be fresh?,"If the stool is not fresh, or in a preservative, the proportion of the different kinds of bacteria in the stool can change, no longer representing the proportions present in the gastrointestinal tract. Overgrowth of normal bacteria can sometimes prevent the detection of the pathogenic bacteria as can exposing the stool sample to temperature extremes."
Why shouldn't I take an over the counter anti-diarrhea medicine when I have infectious diarrhea?,"Diarrhea is one of the methods your body uses to help rid itself of the infection. If you slow down or prevent this from happening by taking anti-diarrhea medication, you can prolong the amount of time that you are ill and sometimes make your infection worse."
"Once I've had a pathogenic bacterial infection, can I be re-infected?","Generally, yes. You may develop a short-term immunity against the particular strain of pathogenic bacteria that caused your infection, but there are many other types and strains of pathogenic bacteria that can make you ill if you are exposed to them."
What else can cause diarrhea?,"Diarrhea can be due to a viral infection such as norovirus, hepatitis A, a parasitic infection such as giardiasis, food intolerance, medications (directly causing diarrhea or indirectly by decreasing normal flora), a bowel disease or bowel dysfunction such as celiac disease, malabsorption, or inflammatory bowel disease. Diarrhea may also be caused or worsened by psychological stresses. See the article on Diarrhea for more on these."
Do I need to stop taking any medications or are there any dietary restrictions for this test?,"No, there is no need to stop taking your medications and you can continue eating the same foods you normally do."
Can I just order the test on the internet and perform it at home?,"You can talk to your healthcare practitioner, who can order the test for you, or you can request the test on the internet through a telemedicine provider. Once the test is ordered, the sample collection kit is mailed to your home. After you collect your sample at home, you will need to return the kit to a laboratory, where trained laboratory personnel perform the actual testing."
What other stool screening tests are available?,"There are two other stool tests available for colon cancer screening. Both tests detect trace amounts of blood in the stool. Neither of these tests detects genetic changes in DNA. If one of these tests is used for colon cancer screening, then screening will need to be done annually.

The first is the fecal immunochemical test that is not combined with a stool DNA test. It is preferred over the guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (see below) because it is sensitive enough that a single sample is considered enough for testing.
The other is the guaiac-based FOBT (gFOBT, FOBT) test. Typically, gFOBT tests are performed on multiple stool samples collected on different days to better detect intermittent bleeding. You would be instructed to avoid certain medications and follow certain dietary restrictions for several days before collecting the stool samples."
"Other than stool tests, are there other ways to screen for colon cancer?","Yes. There are imaging tests that may be used for the detection of precancerous polyps and colon cancer. You and your healthcare practitioner may select one of these procedures instead of screening with a stool DNA test or a fecal occult blood test:

Colonoscopy is recommended by most health organizations as the preferred method of screening for colon cancer. It involves a thorough examination of the rectum and entire colon using a flexible tube. If polyps or potentially cancerous areas are found, they may be removed during the procedure and examined by a pathologist to see if cancer is present. Colonoscopy is recommended every 10 years for average-risk individuals. Colonoscopy, however, requires significant preparation, is invasive, and is much costlier than tests for occult blood in the stool. In individuals with abnormal results on the stool DNA test, colonoscopy is then used as a diagnostic test for colon cancer.
Sigmoidoscopy is an examination of the rectum and lower colon with a lighted instrument. It also allows for the removal of any polyps. Sigmoidoscopy is recommended every 5 to 10 years.
CT colonoscopy (virtual colonoscopy) is a less invasive procedure that uses computed tomography (a CT scan) to visualize the entire colon. The recommended screening interval is 5 years.
Capsule colonoscopy is a procedure that uses a vitamin-sized capsule that is swallowed and contains a wireless camera that transmits pictures as it travels through the digestive tract. Not enough evidence is available on this test yet and it is not widely available. If chosen for screening, capsule colonoscopy should be done every 5 years."
What other laboratory tests might be done if I or my child has a normal elastase test?,"If your signs and symptoms continue and a strong suspicion of pancreatic insufficiency remains, your healthcare practitioner may order stool tests for fecal fat and chymotrypsin or blood tests for amylase and lipase to look at other aspects of pancreas and digestive function. To learn more, read the article on Pancreatic Insufficiency."
What causes pancreatic insufficiency?,"Pancreatic insufficiency can be caused by regular bouts of acute pancreatitis or by chronic pancreatitis. It is less frequently but sometimes associated with pancreatic cancer. Other causes of insufficiency may include celiac disease, Crohn disease, autoimmune pancreatitis (immunoglobulin G4-related disease), Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and some surgical procedures that can lead to a decrease in digestive system or pancreatic function.
In children, pancreatic insufficiency is most frequently associated with cystic fibrosis (CF) or Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS). SDS is the second most common cause of inherited pancreatic insufficiency, after CF. All those with SDS have some degree of pancreatic insufficiency beginning in infancy.
Additionally, people who are carriers of one mutated copy of the CFTR gene, the gene typically responsible for cystic fibrosis, may have pancreatic insufficiency and experience the associated signs and symptoms. (See the article on CF Gene Mutations Testing to learn more about carriers.)"
How long does antibiotic treatment for strep throat usually last?,"Treatment lasts about 10 to 14 days, depending on the antibiotic prescribed. Although your symptoms may improve or disappear before you have taken all of your antibiotics, you should complete your full course of treatment by taking all of the pills that were prescribed."
How long should I stay away from other people if I have a positive test result?,You should complete at least 24 hours of antibiotics before close contact with others.
When can my child go back to school?,"Usually after one full day of therapy and absence of significant fever, your child could return to school. However, a few small studies have found that children may return to school as soon as 12 hours after taking their first dose of antibiotic provided they no longer have a fever and their symptoms have improved."
"If one child in my family has strep throat, is everyone going to get sick?","Other family members, including adults, can be infected by the bacteria. Your healthcare provider may test all family members who have sore throats and may test children under the age of 3. In most cases, it is not necessary to test other family members who do not have symptoms."
I've had strep throat before and was treated with antibiotics. Can I get it again?,"Yes. Although antibodies may protect those who have had previous strep infections, there are so many different strains of the bacteria that it is unlikely you will be immune to all of them. You can potentially get strep throat again and again. The best way to decrease the risk of transmission to others is to minimize close contact with others when ill and wash hands often and thoroughly with soap and water or alcohol-based hand scrub."
Do other group A strep cause other types of infections?,"Yes. Group A strep can also cause infections such as impetigo and, rarely, more serious conditions such as toxic shock syndrome or necrotizing fasciitis (the so-called ""flesh-eating bacteria""). For more details, see the article on Wound and Skin Infections."
Are there other types of strep bacteria that can cause a sore throat?,"Group C and group G strep, normally found in animals, can rarely cause sore throats in humans. However, these bacteria do not pose a risk for the serious secondary complications associated with group A strep. Antibiotic treatment for group A strep will be effective against these bacteria as well."
Can I have a sweat chloride test done at my healthcare provider's office?,"It is unlikely. The sweat chloride test should only be performed at specialized centers that have trained personnel who are experienced with this kind of testing. Otherwise, problems in accuracy, including false negatives due to poor collection technique, can arise. Visit the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to find an accredited testing site near you."
"If one of my children has CF, should my other children be tested?","You may wish to talk to your healthcare provider or a genetic counselor about testing the other siblings for CF gene mutations, regardless of whether they have symptoms, to determine whether they are carriers. Some carriers can experience some symptoms associated with cystic fibrosis. Also, you may want to consider testing and genetic counseling for the siblings so they know whether or not there is a risk that they can pass a mutation to any children they may have in the future."
What other tests might my healthcare provider recommend if my child has CF?,"Your healthcare provider may do other tests, such as chest X-rays as well as lung function tests and pancreas function testing, to determine the severity of your child's CF. This can guide the healthcare provider in recommending a treatment plan and/or a referral to a special CF center where your child can get expert help, advice, and monitoring."
Are there other reasons to do an arthrocentesis?,Yes. Sometimes it will be performed to drain excess synovial fluid – to relieve pressure in the joint and/or to aid in the treatment of an infection. Sometimes medicines such as corticosteroids will be introduced into the joint to help reduce inflammation and/or to relieve pain.
How long does it take to get results from a syphilis test?,Samples are typically sent to a laboratory and results could take 3-5 days.
Why is having syphilis a problem during pregnancy?,"Syphilis in pregnancy can cause many health problems for the infant, including low birth weight, premature delivery, and even stillbirth. In 2014, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) received 458 reports of syphilis cases in children who contracted syphilis from their mothers, known as congenital syphilis. Sometimes newborns with syphilis may not have signs of the disease. However, without immediate treatment, the newborn could develop cataracts, deafness, or seizures. According to the American Sexual Health Association, many cases of congenital syphilis go unnoticed until symptoms appear in childhood or adolescence.
The CDC and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommend that pregnant women be tested for syphilis, preferably at the first prenatal visit. The CDC also recommends testing during the third trimester for higher risk women."
Should I tell my partner that I have syphilis?,"Yes, you should tell your sexual partner(s) that you have syphilis so they can get tested and treated."
"If I get treated, can I get syphilis again?","Yes. Even though treatment will cure your infection, you can get it again if you are exposed again."
What are some other details about T cells?,"During an immune response, it is important that T-cells be able to distinguish between a person's own cells and tissues (self) and foreign and/or infected cells (non-self) as the T-cells are responsible for targeting harmful cells for destruction and for signaling B-cell lymphocytes (another type of WBC) to begin producing antibodies.
Receptors are protein structures on the surface of T-cells that allow them to identify and evaluate self and non-self cells and other substances that can produce an immune response (antigens). There are two types of T-cell receptors, each containing two different subunits. The T-cell receptor genes control the development of these receptor subunits. Rearrangements in these genes are a normal part of T-cell development. The purpose of the rearrangements is to produce a wide variety of receptors within the T-cell population to recognize and address the vast number of antigens that a person may encounter. This means that the receptor gene rearrangements and the receptors in a normal T-cell lymphocyte population are usually very diverse (polyclonal).
With a T-cell lymphoma, an abnormal T-cell lymphocyte begins to clone itself, producing numerous identical cells. The identical, cloned (monoclonal) cells do not function normally, their replication is not regulated, and they may not die as normal cells do. A cancerous monoclonal population of T-cells accumulates, begins to crowd out normal cells, and may eventually spread throughout the lymphatic system and blood to other lymph nodes and tissue, including the bone marrow.
All of the monoclonal cells produced will have identical T-cell receptor gene rearrangement profiles. The cancerous (neoplastic) clones are generally large and therefore the clonal cells are the predominant T-cells present in affected tissue. Detection of a predominant T-cell receptor gene rearrangement profile often indicates the presence of a neoplastic T-cell population. This can help to establish the diagnosis of a T-cell lymphoma or to evaluate for residual or recurrent disease after treatment."
Can results of testing be used to determine the course of my cancer (prognosis)?,"No. A positive testing result only helps to confirm a diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma. The cancer progression and response to treatment is generally determined by the type of a person's lymphoma, but will also vary from person to person."
How common are T-cell lymphomas?,"According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is one of the most common cancers in the United States. ACS estimates that about 72,240 people will be diagnosed with NHL in 2017 and as many as 20,140 will die of it. The majority of these cases (about 85%) will be due to B-cell lymphomas; close to 15% will be T-cell lymphomas."
What medications can affect thyroid testing?,"Many multivitamins, supplements (especially hair, skin, and nail) and over-the-counter and prescription medications may affect thyroid test results, and their use should be discussed with the healthcare practitioner prior to testing. For example, biotin (vitamin B7) can interfere with some lab tests, so your healthcare practitioner may advise you to refrain from taking biotin or supplements that contain biotin for a few days before having blood drawn for thyroid hormone testing. If you have a procedure done in which fluorescein dyes are injected into your blood (e.g., angiography), you may need to wait a few days before having thyroid testing done."
Do healthcare practitioners test thyroid hormones during pregnancy?,"Pregnancy causes normal changes in the function of many endocrine glands, including the thyroid gland. Healthcare practitioners do not generally test asymptomatic women, but those with symptoms and/or a known thyroid disorder will usually be tested at intervals to detect and monitor hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism during pregnancy and after delivery of the baby.
Some experts have advocated screening pregnant women during the first trimester (or preconception) even if they do not have a history of thyroid disease. However, most guidelines do not support this course of action. For more information, see the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) webpage: Thyroid Disease and Pregnancy."

For more information, see the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) webpage: Thyroid Disease and Pregnancy."
My newborn had a free T4 test. Why?,"Newborns commonly have T4 levels and TSH levels tested to check for congenital hypothyroidism. Screening for this condition is routinely performed in the United States on newborns soon after birth as part of each state's newborn screening program. Congenital hypothyroidism occurs when a baby is born with an underactive thyroid gland or a thyroid gland that is not located where it should be or is missing completely. For more details, see the information at the Hormone Health Network's webpage on Congenital Hypothyroidism."
Are there things that I can do to raise or lower my free T4 level?,"In general, free T4 does not respond to lifestyle changes. What is important is that the thyroid gland is producing adequate amounts of free T4 and the body's feedback mechanism is responding appropriately. For those who do not produce enough free T4, thyroid hormone replacement medication can be given."
How long will I need to be on tacrolimus?,Transplant recipients must take tacrolimus or a different immunosuppressant (or combination of drugs) throughout their life. Talk to your healthcare practitioner about the best choice for your condition. This choice may change over time.
Who orders tacrolimus tests?,Tacrolimus will usually be monitored by the transplant team that performed the transplant or by a healthcare practitioner who has specific knowledge of the condition or disease for which the drug is prescribed.
Should I tell my other healthcare providers that I am taking tacrolimus?,"Yes, this is important information for them to have, partially because of drug interactions and partially because of the immunosuppressive action of tacrolimus. It can affect your ability to heal, to get vaccinations, and may increase your risk of developing certain cancers (such as skin cancers)."
What tests are usually done to evaluate a person for Alzheimer disease?,"If someone has symptoms of dementia, a healthcare practitioner will do a thorough work-up to try to determine the cause. This work-up may include a variety of cognitive tests (such as a Minimal Mental State Exam) to assess memory and possibly PET scanning tests of the brain to look for abnormalities. Read the article on Alzheimer Disease for additional details."
How is Alzheimer disease definitively diagnosed?,Alzheimer disease is currently diagnosed based on cognitive changes and by ruling out other causes of these changes. The diagnosis is definitively confirmed after death by looking for microscopic changes in a person's brain tissue. The microscopic evaluation involves looking for the number of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles found in the brain. Characteristic changes on brain scans (MRI or PET scans) and/or low beta amyloid and high tau protein levels in CSF (where available) may be ordered to help establish a diagnosis.
Can I have my blood tested for beta amyloid and tau instead of my CSF?,Not at this time. Studies of blood measurements of beta amyloid and tau have not shown them to be useful in determining what is occurring in a person's brain.
Should I get a tuberculosis skin test if I am pregnant?,"You may be tested under your healthcare practitioner's supervision if there is a need to do so. Since TB can be passed from mother to child during pregnancy, if you are at an increased risk of contracting TB, your healthcare practitioner may want you to have a TST or IGRA done. Either of these is considered safe during pregnancy."
What if I have a TST and it is more than 72 hours before I go back to have it evaluated?,"In most cases, if you do not return within the designated 48-72 hours, then your test cannot be adequately evaluated and would need to be redone."
"What are total testosterone, free testosterone, and bioavailable testosterone?","Most testosterone (up to 98%) circulates in the blood bound to proteins. A small amount of testosterone (less than 4%) circulates in the blood as free testosterone—it is not bound to protein. The bound plus unbound (free) testosterone is measured by labs as total testosterone.
Slightly less than one-third of the protein-bound testosterone is loosely bound to albumin, the main protein in the fluid portion of the blood. About two-thirds is tightly bound to another protein called sex hormone binding globulin or SHBG. The binding between testosterone and albumin is not very strong and is easily reversed. The free testosterone plus the albumin-bound testosterone is the bioavailable testosterone (BAT), which is the portion of testosterone that is available to act on target tissues.
In many cases, measurement of total testosterone provides a healthcare practitioner with adequate information. However, in certain cases, for example when the level of SHBG is abnormal, a test for free or bioavailable testosterone may be performed as it may more accurately reflect the presence of a medical condition. Decreased SHBG levels may be seen in obesity, hypothyroidism, androgen use, and nephrotic syndrome (a form of kidney disease). Increased SHBG levels may be seen with low testosterone production, cirrhosis, hyperthyroidism, and estrogen use."
What other lab tests may be performed?,"Depending on the reason for testing, other tests and hormone levels may be done in addition to testosterone testing. Some examples include:

SHBG
FSH, LH
Estrogens
Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH)
Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS)
Prolactin
17-Hydroxyprogesterone
Androstenedione"
"If I have a low testosterone level, will taking supplemental testosterone help?","Men who are diagnosed with consistently low testosterone levels and have related signs and symptoms may be prescribed testosterone replacement therapy to improve signs and symptoms. The American Urological Association recommends prescribing treatment only to men who meet the clinical and laboratory definitions of low testosterone. Testosterone replacement therapy may not be appropriate for everyone with a diagnosis of low testosterone. For example, the Endocrine Society recommends against routine replacement therapy for men over 65 and suggests making individualized treatment decisions for aging men. Treatment may also be inappropriate for individuals with certain health problems, such as prostate cancer or sleep apnea.
Some of the benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy remain unclear and are the subjects of active research. It is important for you to talk to your healthcare practitioner about expectations for treatment and the potential side effects. Also read the Hormone Health Network patient guide Truth About Testosterone Therapy."
Is there a way to naturally increase my testosterone?,"There is not much that can be done to naturally increase testosterone levels. However, healthy lifestyle choices, including regular exercise, good nutrition, maintaining a healthy weight and avoiding use of illicit drugs and/or excess alcohol, can help keep testosterone levels within a normal range. You may wish to talk to your healthcare practitioner about identifying and treating any underlying conditions or use of medications that might be contributing to your symptoms."
"I am a woman, so why do I need a testosterone test?","Women's bodies also produce testosterone but in small amounts. It is needed for hormonal balance and to help women's bodies to function normally. If your body is producing too much testosterone, you may have more body hair than average, have abnormal or no menstrual periods, or be infertile. A testosterone test, in conjunction with measuring other hormone levels, can help your healthcare provider to understand what is causing your symptoms."
How are testosterone levels used to monitor transgender individuals?,"Some healthcare practitioners may order testosterone levels for transgender individuals to determine whether blood levels have reached or stabilized at target male ranges. Your healthcare practitioner can help explain the meaning of your test results. For more on this topic, visit the Hormone Health Network article on Transgender Health and Mayo Clinic’s article Masculinizing Hormone Therapy."
Are there different ways to measure testosterone as well as free and bioavailable testosterone?,"Yes, there are different methods that labs may use to measure testosterone, and there are reasons for using different methods.

For men, total testosterone can generally be measured using a method called immunoassay. This method is commonly available, less technical to perform, and is usually sufficiently accurate for measuring testosterone in men.
Testosterone levels in women, children, and some men (e.g., those treated for prostate cancer), are much lower than in healthy adult males. In these cases, it is recommended that labs use a method that is sensitive enough to measure testosterone accurately at lower levels. One sensitive method that is often used is called liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This method is more technical to perform and not all labs offer it. Samples may, however, be sent to reference labs for testing.
Free testosterone and bioavailable testosterone may be measured directly, or, more commonly, they are calculated based on results from total testosterone, SHBG and sometimes albumin tests."
Can other drugs I take affect theophylline levels?,"Theophylline can affect, and be affected by, a wide variety of drugs and compounds. When your healthcare practitioner prescribes theophylline, it is important for you to list and discuss all of the prescribed and over-the-counter medications that you are taking, including oral contraceptives and any herbal supplements such as echinacea, chamomile, and gingko. Your healthcare provider will also want to know the amount of caffeine and alcohol that you consume and whether or not you smoke."
Should I tell all of my doctors that I am taking theophylline?,Yes; this is an important part of your medical history and will have an effect on other treatment plans.
How long does a premature neonate have to take caffeine?,"In most cases, the caffeine is a short-term treatment, given for a few weeks until the baby matures and ceases to have apneic episodes."
Why is TDM important?,"Many of the drugs that require therapeutic monitoring are taken for a lifetime. They must be maintained at steady concentrations year after year while the person ages and goes through life events that may alter that individual's therapeutic level, including pregnancies, temporary illnesses, infections, emotional and physical stresses, accidents, and surgeries. Over time, people may acquire other chronic conditions that also require lifetime medication and that may affect the processing of their monitored drugs. Examples of these conditions include cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, thyroid disease, liver disease, and HIV.
Therapeutic drug monitoring follows these changes and accommodates them. It identifies when a person does not take the medication regularly as prescribed (patient noncompliance) and the effect of drug interactions, which may cause drug concentrations that are higher or lower than expected at a given dosage, and helps to personalize a dose to fit the specific needs of a patient. Along with tests such as BUN, creatinine, and liver function tests, therapeutic drug monitoring can help identify decreases in the efficiency of and dysfunctions in the body's ability to metabolize and eliminate therapeutic drugs. Testing may also determine how a medication interacts with other necessary drugs. "
How does a healthcare practitioner determine how much drug to give me?,"There are many factors to consider. Some of them are your weight, body composition, age, and general health and nutritional status. Other factors to consider are if you have any acute or chronic conditions such as kidney, liver, or heart conditions, of if you have suffered burns, shock, or trauma. Your health practitioner takes these into account when prescribing a dosage quantity and frequency and then tailors your medication based upon the results of therapeutic monitoring."
Can I monitor myself at home?,No. Blood must be collected at specific times and tests must be performed using special laboratory equipment.
What should I do if I forget to take my medication on time?,Do not double your dose the next time. Consult your healthcare practitioner or pharmacist to find out what you should do.
What are the pros and cons of the TPMT phenotype test and the genotype test?,"The opinions of medical organizations vary on which TPMT test to recommend. You should consult with your healthcare practitioner about which one best fits your individual situation. For example:

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and prescribing information for azathioprine and mercaptopurine recommend either TPMT genotyping or phenotyping prior to thiopurine treatment.
The American College of Gastroenterology prefers TPMT phenotyping for people who are being treated with thiopurines for inflammatory bowel disease because the phenotype test measures the level of TPMT enzyme activity."
Can the thrombin time be performed in my doctor's office?,"With the exception of a PT test, bleeding disorder tests, including the thrombin time, require specialized equipment and reagents and are typically performed in a laboratory."
Can I have decreased or abnormal fibrinogen and not know it?,"Yes. For many people, the clotting process functions relatively normally even when fibrinogen concentrations and/or activity are decreased. Your condition may not be identified unless pre-surgery screening identifies a potential problem or you bleed longer than expected after a surgical procedure or trauma."
Can thrombin time be used for monitoring dabigatran therapy?,"Dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, is one of the newly approved oral anticoagulants. Routine therapeutic monitoring is not required; however, monitoring may be needed in certain clinical conditions. Thrombin time or a modified plasma-diluted thrombin time (dTT) has been advocated for monitoring dabigatran therapy, but it has not been widely accepted as the standard practice. Instead, direct measurement of dabigatran level should be used if monitoring is indicated."
I will have several thyroglobulin tests done over time. Why do I need to have them done at the same lab?,"Laboratories may use different methods to test for thyroglobulin, so results can vary from lab to lab. If you are having a series of thyroglobulin tests done (several tests done on different days), it is advised that you have the tests done by the same method, typically by the same laboratory, so that the results can be compared and interpreted correctly. You may wish to discuss this issue with your healthcare provider."
I also had a test for thyroglobulin antibodies done. Why?,"Thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) are immune proteins produced that target thyroglobulin. Approximately 25% of patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer have detectable TgAb. Depending on the test method used by the laboratory, these antibodies can interfere with the results of the thyroglobulin test when present in the blood of the person being tested. If the antibodies are present, the Tg test may be unreliable for monitoring thyroglobulin levels. Alternatively, a test method that is not affected by TgAb may be used to monitor thyroglobulin. Recently it has become recognized that monitoring the trend in the TgAb level itself can be a useful marker for the presence/or absence of disease. Read the article on Thyroid Antibodies to learn more."
Why didn't my healthcare practitioner check my thyroglobulin level before removing my thyroid?,"Your thyroglobulin (Tg) level may or may not be measured before your thyroid gland is removed as part of the treatment for thyroid cancer. Since the protein is produced by normal thyroid tissue as well as by many thyroid cancers and can be elevated with many thyroid conditions, it can be difficult to determine whether an increased thyroglobulin is due to the cancer. However, once a diagnosis of thyroid cancer has been made from a biopsy of a thyroid nodule, a high thyroglobulin level before surgery is a useful indicator that the tumor produces thyroglobulin, indicating the usefulness of thyroglobulin as a post-operative tumor marker."
Is there anything I can do to raise or lower my thyroglobulin level?,"No, not directly. This test reflects the presence of normal and/or cancerous thyroid tissue and is not affected by lifestyle changes. Missing doses of your daily thyroid hormone treatment can cause TSH to rise, which in turn can stimulate thyroglobulin production from the small amount of normal thyroid tissue that typically remains following surgery for thyroid cancer."
Can thyroglobulin testing be performed in my healthcare practitioner's office?,"No, it requires specialized equipment to perform. The test may not be offered in every laboratory and may need to be sent to a reference laboratory. Due to certain technical limitations of the assay methods, normal reference ranges can vary and some thyroglobulin tests are unreliable in the presence of thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb). Thus, when serial thyroglobulin levels are required, they should be performed at the same laboratory."
Are thyroid antibodies part of routine thyroid testing?,"No, they are usually only indicated when a person has an enlarged thyroid or symptoms suggesting thyroid dysfunction. Routine screening of the thyroid is usually accomplished using thyroid tests such as TSH and free T4."
Can thyroid antibody testing be done in my doctor's office?,"Though a blood sample may be collected at your healthcare provider's office, it will likely be sent to a laboratory for testing. These tests require specialized equipment to perform and are not offered by every laboratory. It may take several days for the results to be available."
What medications can affect a TSH test?,"Many multivitamins, supplements (especially hair and nail), and over-the-counter and prescription medications may affect thyroid test results and their use should be discussed with your healthcare practitioner prior to testing. For example, biotin (vitamin B7) can interfere with some lab tests, so your healthcare practitioner may advise you to refrain from taking biotin or supplements that contain biotin for a few days before having blood drawn for a TSH test. If you have a procedure done in which fluorescein dyes are injected into your blood (e.g., angiography), you may need to wait a few days before having a TSH test done."
Do healthcare practitioners test TSH during pregnancy?,"Pregnancy causes normal changes in the function of many endocrine glands, including the thyroid gland. Healthcare practitioners do not generally test asymptomatic women, but those with symptoms and/or a known thyroid disorder will usually be tested at intervals to detect and monitor hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism during pregnancy and after delivery of the baby.
Some experts have advocated screening pregnant women for elevated TSH during the first trimester (or preconception) even if they do not have a history of thyroid disease. However, most guidelines do not support this course of action.
For more information, see the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) webpage: Thyroid Disease and Pregnancy."
My newborn had a TSH test done. Why?,"A TSH test may be used to screen for congenital hypothyroidism. Screening for this condition is routinely performed in the United States on newborns soon after birth as part of each state's newborn screening program. Congenital hypothyroidism occurs when a baby is born with an underactive thyroid gland or a thyroid gland that is not located where it should be or is missing completely. For more details, see the information at the Hormone Health Network's webpage on Congenital Hypothyroidism."
Are there things that I can do to raise or lower my TSH level?,"In general, TSH does not respond to lifestyle changes. What is important is that the pituitary and thyroid glands are healthy and working together to produce appropriate amounts of thyroid hormone."
What type of testing is used to confirm infection with these microorganisms?,"To make the diagnosis of an active infection with one of the TORCH pathogens, more specific confirmatory tests may be required. In a baby, cerebrospinal fluid testing (requiring a lumbar puncture or ""spinal tap"") is often used to confirm toxoplasmosis, herpes and rubella; urine may be cultured for cytomegalovirus; and skin lesions may be scraped and cultured for herpes simplex virus. Making the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis in the pregnant woman or the baby may require additional blood samples, which are sent to a reference lab that specializes in this testing."
Is there anything I can do to lower my IgE level?,"Other than limiting your exposure to things that you are allergic to, no. The total IgE concentration is not influenced by lifestyle changes, and lowering it would not have an effect on the number or type of allergies that you have."
Can the total IgE test be performed in my doctor’s office?,"In some cases, it might be available in an office or clinic, such as with a healthcare provider who specializes in allergies, but in most cases it will be performed in a laboratory."
How effective is the skin test for allergies?,"The skin of the arm or back is pricked with a needle containing a specific allergen, causing a red swelling when positive. It is very specific but requires multiple skin pricks for each type of allergen to be tested and must be interpreted by a trained specialist."
Will a high protein diet raise my total protein level?,"No, eating more protein will not increase your total protein test result."
What type of nutrition is recommended for optimal protein levels?,There is no specific diet. A well-balanced diet that follows the recommendations of the United States Department of Agriculture is summarized by the USDA Choose My Plate.
What are globulin proteins and how are they measured in blood?,"Globulins are a group of proteins in the blood, some produced by the liver and some by the immune system. They help fight infection and transport nutrients. There are four main types: alpha 1, alpha 2, beta, and gamma. They are measured using different tests:

Total protein test—measures albumin and globulin
Serum protein electrophoresis—can be used to measure the different groups of globulin proteins"
Can protein be measured in samples other than blood?,"Yes, a test for protein can be performed on many different types of body fluids. Proteins are also measured in urine. The purpose of urine testing and the meaning of results are different than from blood. See the articles on Body Fluid Testing, Urine Protein, and Urinalysis for more information."
Is toxoplasmosis contagious?,"It is not directly passed from person to person, except from mother-to-child. Almost all cases of infections come from eating, drinking, or handling something that is contaminated."
Should everyone be tested for toxoplasmosis?,"Since the infection is very common and in most cases does not cause symptoms, general screening is not currently recommended."
"Once I have had a Toxoplasma gondii infection, can I get infected again?","In general, once you have been infected and the primary infection becomes dormant, you have immunity against re-infection from an outside source if you remain healthy. However, if your immune system is weakened for some reason, a dormant infection may become reactivated. It is thought that most infections in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS, are due to reactivations rather than new infections."
Why is the T. gondii infection rate higher in some countries?,"The infection rate is higher in hot, humid locations and is influenced by the regional diet. It is higher in areas where people routinely eat undercooked meat."
Is toxoplasmosis treatable?,"Most healthy people do not require treatment, but there are treatments available for those with compromised immune systems, for pregnant women to help lessen the risk that the infection will be passed to the fetus, and for newborns with congenital toxoplasmosis. For more on treatment, see the Mayo Clinic or CDC web sites."
"Besides antibody and molecular tests, are there other ways of testing for toxoplasmosis?","Other tests, such as an IgG avidity test, may be performed by a reference laboratory to help confirm a T. gondii infection. Rarely, a sample of tissue may be removed (biopsy) from an area of the body that is suspected of being infected with the Toxoplasma parasite. The sample may be cultured and/or stained and examined under a microscope to detect the parasite. These procedures are usually reserved for cases that are difficult to diagnose."
Should everyone have their levels of trace minerals tested? ,It is generally not necessary. Most people in the United States who eat a variety of foods will get a sufficient amount of trace minerals from their diet.
Should I take mineral supplements? ,"Talk to your healthcare practitioner about taking supplements. If you are deficient, supplements may be of benefit to you, but there is no strong evidence to suggest that they benefit the average individual and may, in fact, increase your risk of toxicity. Those who take excess zinc can inhibit their use of copper. People who store excess iron or copper in their bodies must restrict and monitor their intake of these minerals as the buildup can damage tissues and organs."
What other minerals are required by the body? ,"Macrominerals are minerals that are required in greater amounts than trace minerals. They include sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, and phosphorus. Some also include sulfur in this category."
What other micronutrients are required by the body? ,"Micronutrients include trace minerals, the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K, and the water-soluble vitamins C and B complex (biotin, folate, niacin, pantothenic acid, riboflavin, thiamin, B6 and B12)."
How is transferrin saturation calculated?,"The calculation is:
Transferrin saturation (%) = (Serum iron level x 100%) / TIBC
TIBC measures the total amount of iron that can be bound by proteins in the blood. Since transferrin is the primary iron-binding protein, the TIBC test is a good indirect measurement of transferrin availability—the amount of transferrin that is available to bind to iron.
In healthy individuals, transferrin is one-third saturated with iron. This means that there is about two-thirds held in reserve. In iron deficiency, all of the stored iron is used and the body tries to compensate by producing more transferrin to increase iron transport. While the serum iron level continues to decrease, the transferrin level increases. Thus, the amount of transferrin available to bind iron (TIBC) increases and the amount of transferrin saturated with iron (i.e., percent transferrin saturation) decreases."
What other factors affect the transferrin level?,"Transferrin is a protein that may decrease during any inflammatory process and is referred to as a negative acute phase reactant. Chronic inflammation, infections, and malignancies may cause changes in transferrin levels."
Are there other things that cause anemia besides iron deficiency?,"Yes, there are numerous causes of anemia. However, iron deficiency is one of the most common. If iron tests rule out iron deficiency, another source for the anemia must be found. See the article on Anemia for more on this."
Should I tell my partner that I have trichomoniasis?,"Yes, you should tell your sexual partner(s) that you have trichomoniasis so that they can get tested and treated."
What complications can occur if the infection is not properly treated?,"Untreated or improperly treated trichomoniasis can result in an infection that can increase the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and cervical neoplasia - a possible precursor to cervical cancer - in women. Pregnant women with trichomoniasis are at higher risk for having pre-term or low birth weight babies. Men are sometimes asymptomatic, resulting in chronic infection and re-infection of partner(s). In men, infection may lead to inflammation of the urethra and chronic prostatitis. In both men and women, trichomoniasis is a risk factor for HIV and is associated with infertility."
"If I get treated, can I get trichomoniasis again?","Yes. Even though treatment will cure your infection, you can get it again if you are exposed again. In fact, about one in five people get reinfected within 3 months after receiving treatment, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
What strategies can be used to lower triglyceride levels?,"For many people, high triglycerides are caused by another disorder, such as diabetes, obesity, renal failure, or alcoholism. With these conditions, the strategy is to treat the primary cause. When high triglycerides are not caused by another disorder, they are often seen together with high cholesterol and treatment is directed toward lowering both cholesterol and triglycerides. Lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet and increased exercise, are usually the primary strategy for lowering levels. If these fail, lipid-lowering medications such as statins are generally recommended. For more on this, visit the American Heart Association's webpage on Healthy Living."
Can I monitor triglyceride levels at home?,"A few products are available to test lipid levels, including triglycerides, at home. There are two types of home testing: those where you collect the sample at home and then mail it away to a laboratory for testing and those where you conduct the test yourself at home (self-monitoring). The American Heart Association hasn't taken a position on the use of home testing devices for measuring lipid levels. Before making the decision to use one of these products, you may want to review the article about home testing on this site: With Home Testing, Consumers Take Charge of Their Health."
Are there any symptoms associated with a high level of triglycerides?,"Usually, most people with high triglyceride levels have no symptoms and the only means of discovering a high level is with blood tests. However, in rare cases, a person may have an extremely high level of triglycerides (well above 1000 mg/dL) sustained over time and the individual may experience repeated bouts of acute pancreatitis. Some of the signs and symptoms include pain in the upper half of the stomach area that develops suddenly and then gradually gets worse, fever, nausea, vomiting, and sometimes jaundice. A person with severely high levels may also develop lesions on the skin called xanthomas. These typically appear as several small, round, solid, yellow bumps mostly on the back, chest, buttocks, shoulders and thighs."
What does heart attack mean?,"Heart attack means that some of the muscle tissue in your heart is severely injured or has died. The medical term for the death of cardiac muscle is myocardial infarction. Because it is not always possible to determine whether there is only serious injury or there is infarction, the general term for the condition is acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
Most commonly, a heart attack starts with a sensation of heavy pressure or pain in the chest, often extending into the neck or left arm. You may have trouble catching your breath or you may feel weak and break into a cold sweat. Read about What a Heart Attack Feels Like from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.
A heart attack usually occurs because one of the blood vessels (called coronary arteries) that brings blood to your heart muscle is blocked. This usually happens when a blood clot forms in a blood vessel that is already partially closed. The partial closure is usually due to atherosclerosis (often called hardening of the arteries). Obstruction occurs gradually over many years as lipid plaques are deposited along the walls of the blood vessels. These plaques narrow and stiffen the arteries and can rupture unexpectedly, totally blocking off the affected artery."
"If I have chest pain, does that mean I am having a heart attack?","Many other problems can cause chest pain, and it is not possible to tell from the type of chest pain whether or not you are having a heart attack. Many people have chest pain from straining the muscles in their chest, from heartburn or other problems involving the stomach and esophagus, from emotional stress, and with some lung problems. Chest pain that occurs during exercise, hard work, or at times of stress, lasts for a few minutes, and goes away with rest is often caused by angina. A relatively rare form of chest pain may be due to temporary heart spasms called variant angina. These spasms usually occur at night when a person is resting and can cause severe but temporary pain.
If chest pain lasts longer than just a few minutes, especially if it occurs when you are resting, seek immediate medical attention."
What if I am not sure if I am having a heart attack?,"Many people are not sure if they are experiencing a heart attack. If you are unsure, don't wait, but get help. Getting help right away can help you survive and treatments given soon after a heart attack can help limit the damage to your heart.
Note that not everyone will experience chest pain, and women are more likely than men to have signs and symptoms that are not typical. In women, symptoms are often less dramatic and more likely to be misinterpreted as due to another cause than in men. Some heart attacks are sudden while other heart attacks start slowly. The pain and other symptoms may come and go. Signs and symptoms may include:

Chest pain, discomfort and/or pressure (most common)
Rapid heart rate, skipping a beat
Nausea and vomiting or stomach pain
Sweating
Sudden onset of shortness of breath
Difficulty breathing
Feeling lightheaded
Change in blood pressure
Fatigue
Pain on other places such as the back, one or both arms, jaw or neck"
What other tests may be performed?,"Other tests may be used to evaluate a person's health status and to help rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. These may include:

Allergen-specific IgE blood tests to help determine the cause of an allergic reaction
Complete blood count (CBC) to evaluate red and white blood cells
Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) to evaluate organ function
5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) urine test to rule out a carcinoid tumor that may cause similar symptoms, such as flushing, diarrhea, and/or wheezing
Gastrin test to look for increased secretion of this hormone, which may cause stomach or intestinal ulcers"
Can tryptase testing be done in my doctor's office?,"No, the tryptase test is a specialized test that is not offered in every laboratory and the sample must usually be sent to a reference laboratory for testing."
"If I think I have an allergy, should I have a tryptase test done?","Your healthcare practitioner may order specific allergy tests to help determine the substances you are allergic to, but a tryptase test would usually be done only if severe allergic symptoms are present. Most people with allergies will never need to have a tryptase test performed."
"If I have an elevated tryptase, does this mean I have mastocytosis?","Not necessarily. Tryptase is just one of the criteria that your healthcare provider will consider before making a diagnosis of mastocytosis, which is a rare disorder."
"Is there a reason to test a ""peak"" sample when my TNF inhibitor should be at its highest level, or a random sample (neither peak nor trough)?","No, the test has been developed to be interpreted as a trough level – when the TNF inhibitor will be at its lowest level."
Can I have my test performed in my healthcare practitioner’s office?,The test requires specialized equipment. Your sample will need to be sent to a laboratory.
Are the two tests always done together?,"Not necessarily. Sometimes the TNF inhibitor level or activity test is performed first. If the level or activity is low, then the TNF inhibitor antibody test is performed. This is called reflex testing. The two tests can be done on the same blood sample."
"Once I have developed TNF inhibitor antibodies, will they go away?","In most cases, these antibodies persist for as long as you receive that TNF inhibitor therapy. While antibody levels may decrease between doses or drop to undetectable levels if you are switched to a different therapy, the antibodies will usually come back if you are given another dose and/or started on the therapy again."
Can TNF inhibitor therapy cure my autoimmune disorder?,"No. It can help ease symptoms and let damaged tissues heal. It may help your condition go into remission, but it will not make it go away. Some progressive tissue damage such as scarring and joint erosion may not heal."
Do I need to tell other healthcare practitioners that I am on TNF inhibitor therapy?,"Yes, this is important information for them to have as it may affect other treatment decisions. An example of this is that you should not get any live vaccines while receiving TNF inhibitor therapy, and neither should your newborn if you are on TNF inhibitor therapy during pregnancy. Additionally, your healthcare practitioner should be notified because the therapy suppresses your immune system, increasing your risk of infections, such as COVID-19 and tuberculosis."
"If I develop antibodies to one type of TNF inhibitor therapy, and I am switched to a different one, will I develop antibodies to the second TNF inhibitor?","It is possible that you will develop TNF inhibitor antibodies to a second therapy. If your autoimmune condition remains active or you do not respond to the second therapy, you may need additional TNF inhibitor testing."
"My uric acid level is high, but I don't have gout. What does this mean?","Not everyone who has high uric acid gets gout. High levels of uric acid in the blood do not always lead to symptoms. This condition, called asymptomatic hyperuricemia, is fairly common. It is generally thought that this condition does not require any follow up or treatment unless the affected person is at a high risk of complications. People with family members who have had gout, kidney stones or kidney disease due to hyperuricemia may receive treatment even though they are not experiencing symptoms."
Is the time of day a factor when collecting a urine sample?,"Because this is a general screening test, time of collection is usually not important, although a first morning void may be preferred because it is more concentrated. However, if your healthcare provider is looking for a specific finding, you may be asked to collect a sample at a specific time."
Can a urinalysis be done in my healthcare practitioner’s office?,"Many healthcare providers' offices and clinics can perform the visual and chemical examinations of urine. Some may also be able to provide microscopic examinations. Sometimes, if abnormal results are found on the visual or chemical exams, your urine sample may be sent to a laboratory for the microscopic exam. Alternatively, your sample may be sent to a laboratory for a full urinalysis."
Are there home test kits available to test my urine?,"Kits to perform a full urinalysis are not available because the test requires special equipment and technical skills. However, some commercial testing strips can be purchased at a pharmacy to perform part of the chemical examination, such as urine pH, urine glucose, and urine ketones."
Are there other reasons for having increased urine albumin levels?,"Yes, albumin in the urine (albuminuria) is not specific for diabetes. It may also be associated with hypertension (high blood pressure), some lipid abnormalities, and several immune disorders. Elevated results may also be caused by vigorous exercise, blood in the urine, urinary tract infection, dehydration, and some drugs."
"What is the difference between serum/plasma albumin, prealbumin, and urine albumin tests?","Although the names are similar, albumin and prealbumin are completely different molecules. They are both proteins made by the liver, however, and both have been used historically to evaluate nutritional status. Serum or plasma (or blood) albumin is now more often used to screen for and help diagnose liver or kidney disease. The urine albumin test detects and measures albumin in the urine as an early indicator of kidney damage."
"Can a urine culture be used to test for infections other than UTIs, such as sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)?","Yes. Urine cultures can detect some sexually transmitted diseases. However, a urine culture is not the test of choice for sexually transmitted diseases in adults. Some STDs such as chlamydia may be tested using a urine sample, but the testing method used detects chlamydia genetic material in the urine and is not a culture. Tell your healthcare practitioner if you think you have a sexually transmitted disease, so the practitioner can order the appropriate test. (For examples, read the articles on Chlamydia Testing and Gonorrhea Testing.) Urine cultures may be used to test for STDs in children.
For another example, a urine culture may be used to help diagnose infections of the urinary tract and genital tract caused by mycobacteria. Typically, this test requires that the first urine voided in the morning be collected."
"My healthcare practitioner's office called to say they need a new urine sample, the first was contaminated. What happened?","If the skin and genital area were not cleaned well prior to collecting the sample, the urine culture may grow three or more different types of bacteria and is assumed to be contaminated. The culture will be discarded because it cannot be determined if the bacteria originated inside or outside the urinary tract. A contaminated specimen can be avoided by following the directions to carefully clean yourself and by collecting a mid-stream clean catch urine sample."
My healthcare practitioner said I had symptoms of a urinary tract infection and prescribed antibiotics without performing a urine culture. Why?,"Bacteria known as Escherichia coli (E. coli) cause the majority of lower urinary tract infections. This microbe is usually susceptible to a variety of antibiotics, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin. In most people with an uncomplicated UTI, the infection will be cured after treatment with one of these antibiotics. Based on this information, your healthcare practitioner may prescribe one of them without performing a culture."
What puts me at risk for recurrent urinary tract infections?,"There are a wide variety of factors that predispose a person to get a UTI. UTIs are more common in girls and women than in boys and men because of the differences in their genitals and urinary tracts. Some infants and young children have abnormalities of the urinary tract that they are born with (congenital) that increase their risk of UTIs. In adults, sexual intercourse, diabetes, pregnancy, poor bladder control, kidney stones, and tumors are examples of factors that increase risk of UTIs. In a hospital, nursing home, or home care setting, urinary catheters are major risk factors for UTIs."
Can I have more than one pheochromocytoma at once?,"Yes. Usually a single adrenal tumor will arise in one gland or the other, but multiple tumors can form. This is more likely in people with a strong family history of pheochromocytomas. You may have a tumor in each adrenal gland or occasionally in other locations."
Does the amount of urine metanephrines detected correspond to the size of the tumor?,"No, it has more to do with the characteristics of the tumor. Even a very small tumor can produce large amounts of catecholamines."
Is it really necessary to collect urine for 24 hours?,"Yes, for accurate test results, it is essential that all of the urine be collected. Catecholamines are released at varying times, so the one sample not included might be the one with the most metanephrines in it. For general instructions, read about the 24-hour urine collection."
"If I have a positive urine protein test, what other tests might be done in follow up?","A positive urine protein test tells your healthcare practitioner that protein is present in your urine, but it does not indicate which types are present or the cause of the proteinuria. When investigating the reason, your healthcare practitioner may order additional laboratory tests, such as:

Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)—includes tests such as BUN, creatinine, albumin and total protein, which help evaluate kidney and liver function
A full urinalysis—if a condition such as urinary tract infection is also suspected
Serum and urine protein electrophoresis test—to determine which proteins are being released into the urine and in what quantities; this is especially true if your healthcare practitioner suspects abnormal monoclonal protein production, such as with multiple myeloma or lymphoma.

See the article on Proteinuria for more on follow-up tests.
If kidney disease or damage is suspected, your healthcare practitioner may also order imaging scans (ultrasonography or CT scan) to evaluate the appearance of your kidneys."
Can I test for protein in my urine at home?,"There are urine dipstick kits available that allow you to monitor the protein in your urine. This is usually not necessary, though, unless your healthcare provider is monitoring a known kidney condition."
Does kidney damage go away?,"In general, it does not. The goal is to detect kidney disease and damage early to minimize the damage and prolong kidney function. If the proteinuria detected is due to a kidney infection or urinary tract infection, the kidneys frequently will return to normal function as the infection resolves. If it is due to a medication, then in most cases the kidneys are likely to return to normal or near-normal function when the medication is stopped."
Should I eat more protein to make up for lost protein?,"This is something to discuss with your healthcare provider. If you have severe protein shortages, then that will need to be addressed, but consuming additional protein also puts additional stress on your kidneys."
How long will I need to be on valproic acid?,Valproic acid is usually taken every day (sometimes several times a day) for a person's lifetime. An exception to this may be those whose seizures are caused by a temporary condition; they may only need the medication for a short period of time.
How is valproic acid taken?,"It may be taken as a tablet, slow release tablet, a liquid, or sprinkled on a soft food. It is generally taken with food to minimize stomach upset, and it is important that the solid forms be swallowed, not chewed, to avoid mouth and throat irritation."
Can I test my valproic acid level at my doctor's office?,"No, it requires specialized equipment. Blood samples are collected from a vein in the arm and tested in the laboratory."
Why do I have to collect my urine for 24 hours?,"The reason that you need to collect your urine over a 24-hour period is because the amount of VMA released in the urine changes during the course of a day. By collecting all urine for 24 hours, the amount of VMA measured can be averaged over the entire day and will give a better indication of whether levels are increased or not."
Will my results be accurate if I must continue to take my medication?,"If the drug is one that can increase or decrease the amount of VMA, then your results may be affected. However, it is up to your healthcare practitioner and you to decide whether or not your medication can be safely stopped prior to and during the test collection. If your drugs must be taken, then your healthcare practitioner will interpret the test results with this in mind."
Are some people at a higher risk for developing a pheochromocytoma or neuroblastoma?,"People with a family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN2), a genetic condition that increases a person's risk of developing tumors in the endocrine system glands, may be at higher risk for developing a pheochromocytoma, having more than one, and developing it at a younger age. Most cases of neuroblastomas are considered ""sporadic,"" but about 1% to 2% of cases may be due to inherited factors such as a mutation in the ALK gene. Those with a strong family history may have an increased risk."
What are the dietary sources of vitamin A?,"Sources of preformed vitamin A include meat (especially liver), eggs, dairy products, and fortified foods. Sources of carotene (mainly beta carotene) include brightly colored fruits and vegetables such as carrots, spinach, apricots, sweet potatoes, and cantaloupe."
What are the recommended dietary allowances (RDA) for vitamin A?,"For teens and adults age 14 and older, the RDA is 900 micrograms (mcg) (3,000 IU) for males and 700 mcg (2,310 IU) for females. The recommendations for others, such as infants, children and pregnant women, vary. For these, see the lists provided by the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements."
Can vitamin A testing be done in my healthcare practitioner's office?,"No, this test requires specialized equipment and is not offered by every laboratory. In many cases, your blood will be sent to a reference laboratory."
Can taking too many vitamin B12 and folic acid supplements hurt me?,"Not usually. B12 and folic acid are water-soluble, thus the body will rid itself of any excess by eliminating it in the urine. However, taking folic acid can mask low B12 levels, so it can be important to be tested for both before beginning folate supplementation. Individuals who are allergic to cobalt should not take B12, and those with the hereditary eye disease Leber's disease may experience harm to the optic nerve if they take B12"
Should everyone have vitamin B12 and folate tests?,"These tests are generally not necessary if you do not have symptoms associated with a deficiency, you do not have large red blood cells (RBCs) as determined by a complete blood count (CBC), or you do not have a disease or condition associated with malabsorption. "
Should every pregnant woman have a folate test?,Folate levels may be tested during prenatal checkups. Folate supplementation is generally recommended for women before and during pregnancy.
Can I have B12 and folate tests done in my doctor's office?,These tests require specialized equipment and are typically performed in a laboratory. 
How much vitamin D should I be getting each day?,"It depends on your age and sex. In 2010, the Institute of Medicine set the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) for both calcium and vitamin D. For details, see the report: DRIs for Calcium and Vitamin D."
Is fortifying milk and cereals with vitamin D a good practice?,"Yes. The amount of vitamin D produced by the body may be insufficient, especially when there is limited exposure to sunlight and routine use of sunscreens. Since dietary vitamin D is found naturally only in a few foods, such as cod liver oil, dietary intake would not be sufficient for most people. However, in the United States, vitamin D is routinely added to milk, fortified cereals, and fruit juices to ensure adequate dietary availability. Fortification of milk and infant formula has been a real success story in the United States, drastically reducing the rate of juvenile rickets and making it a relatively rare occurrence."
Can I get my vitamin D from yogurt and cheese?,"Maybe. Although all milk is fortified, many dairy products are not, or are to a lesser extent."
Are there other uses for vitamin D?,"Yes, there is a topical form of vitamin D cream that is used to treat psoriasis. Research is being done in other areas, including the potential use of vitamin D to help control autoimmune conditions."
Is vitamin D a necessary component of calcium supplements?,"Since absorption of calcium is dependent on vitamin D, many manufacturers of calcium supplements add vitamin D to assure optimal calcium uptake. If you have adequate amounts of vitamin D from other sources, the additional vitamin D is not necessary. The amount of vitamin D in these tablets is not likely to lead to excess vitamin D or be harmful either."
How can I lower my VLDL-C level?,"Because of the relationship between VLDL and triglycerides, you can lower your VLDL cholesterol level by taking steps to lower your triglyceride level. These include making healthy lifestyle changes, such as losing excess weight and exercising regularly. It has also been advised to avoid sugary foods and alcohol in particular since these have a strong effect on triglycerides. Cholesterol-lowering medication may also be recommended. Talk to your healthcare provider about what is right for you."
Can VWF testing be performed in my doctor's office?,VWF testing must be performed in a laboratory and is often sent to a reference laboratory. It requires specialized equipment and interpretation.
"If I have heavy menstrual periods, do I have von Willebrand disease (VWD)?","It is possible, but many women who experience heavy bleeding during menstruation do not have VWD."
Can I have VWD and not know it?,"Yes. Some people experience no or few symptoms, even though they have quantitative or qualitative VWF deficiencies."
Should I tell my other doctors I have von Willebrand disease?,"Yes. This is important information for your healthcare providers, including your dentist, to have. They will need to plan ahead for any surgeries, childbirths, or dental procedures you may have."
Are there other causes of VWF deficiency besides inherited causes?,"Yes, a deficiency in VWF may be due to another disease or condition, where there is no family or personal bleeding history up to the point when signs and symptoms develop, but this rarely occurs. It is sometimes seen in people with:
• Conditions that cause the breakdown of VWF, such as increased pressure in the arteries leading from the heart to the lungs (pulmonary hypertension) and structural defects of the heart (e.g., aortic valve stenosis)
• Lymphoma, myeloma, or autoimmune disorders (such as lupus) that cause the production of VWF antibodies
• Myeloproliferative neoplasms associated with increased platelet production that cause increased binding of VWF to platelets
• Hypothyroidism, which can decrease VWF production
• Wilms tumor and other disorders that bind to VWF and remove it from the blood
• Certain medications such as valproic acid, ciprofloxacin, hetastarch"
"If I have genetic testing done, will I still need to be monitored with PT/INR tests? ","Yes. Regardless of your genetic makeup, your response to warfarin therapy will still need to be monitored with regular PT/INR tests. This is because your individual degree of anticoagulation (""blood-thinning"") can be affected by other factors such as diet, age, weight, other medications and state of health, which can change over time."
Can warfarin sensitivity testing be done in my doctor's office?,"No, it requires specialized equipment to perform and expertise to interpret. It is not offered by every laboratory and may need to be sent to a laboratory outside of your hospital (i.e., reference laboratory)."
Will I need to have this test done more than once?,No. This test determines information about the genes you have inherited. This information does not change so you will only need to be tested once.
Should I tell other doctors about my warfarin sensitivity?,"Yes, and you should always tell them that you are taking warfarin. The use of warfarin and your sensitivity to warfarin is important information for the medical professionals (including dentists) that you see. It can have an effect on your treatment options. CYP2C9 is involved in metabolism of many other drugs."
Should my other family members be tested for warfarin sensitivity?,"This is something to discuss with your healthcare provider and family. It is not generally indicated unless a family member is also going to be taking warfarin, but having a family member who has warfarin sensitivity is important information to keep in mind and to share with your healthcare practitioner."
Is there a vaccine for West Nile virus (WNV)?,"Not for humans yet, but there may be one or more vaccines available in the next few years. Research is ongoing. Vaccines for other flaviviruses, such as yellow fever, have been available for about 70 years and have well-established safety and efficacy records, so researchers are optimistic that a solution can be found."
Are people who have no symptoms ever tested for WNV?,"Testing is usually not done for asymptomatic people, but when a blood or organ recipient becomes infected with WNV, both IgM and IgG antibodies may be ordered on the donor (who is frequently asymptomatic) to help determine whether that person was the source of the infection.
Similarly, if a breastfeeding baby contracts WNV, the mother will likely be tested to determine whether the infection may have passed to the baby through the mother's milk (a rare but documented event).
Moreover, all donated blood is tested for contamination with WNV by NAAT. Donors suspected of having WNV in their blood are notified and referred for counseling."
Is it safe to donate and receive blood?,"Yes. There is no risk for the donor, and WNV nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) have been added to the list of extensive testing that is done to make the U.S. blood supply as safe as it can possibly be for the recipients. As an additional tool in reducing WNV in the blood supply, blood collection centers have recently started asking potential donors during WNV season if they have had a recent fever or headache (symptoms of an infection with WNV or other virus)."
Can a WBC count be performed on a sample other than blood?,"Yes. WBC counts may be performed on many different types of body fluids. A common reason that this is done is to more directly assess one area of the body that may be infected or inflamed. For example, if meningitis is suspected, then a WBC count plus differential may be performed on a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Many other examples are listed in the article on Body Fluid Analysis."
"If I have an abnormal WBC count, what other tests might my doctor order?  ","Other general tests your healthcare practitioner can use to check your health may include a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP). Depending on your signs, symptoms, medical history, physical exam and suspected condition, your healthcare provider may choose to order a variety of other tests. A few general examples include:

Bacterial infection: a culture of the affected area (e.g., urine culture, sputum culture, blood culture), strep test
Viral infection: tests for mononucleosis, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
Inflammation: CRP (preferred), ESR
Autoimmune diseases: ANA
Allergies: Allergy tests
Leukemia: Bone marrow biopsy, immunophenotyping (e.g., flow cytometry), chromosome analysis"
Can a white blood cell (WBC) differential be performed on samples other than blood?,"Yes. WBC differentials, along with WBC counts, may be performed on many different types of body fluids. A common reason that this is done is to more directly assess one area of the body that may be infected or inflamed. For example, if meningitis is suspected, then a WBC count plus differential may be performed on a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Many other examples are listed in the article on Body Fluid Analysis."
"If I have an abnormal result on my WBC differential, what other tests might my healthcare provider order? ","Other general tests to check your health may include a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP). Depending on your signs, symptoms, medical history, physical exam and suspected condition, your healthcare provider may choose to order a variety of other tests. A few general examples include:
• Bacterial infection: a culture of the affected area (e.g., urine culture, sputum culture, blood culture), strep test
• Viral infection: tests for mononucleosis, Epstein-Barr virus
• Inflammation: C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
• Autoimmune diseases: Antinuclear antibody
• Allergies: Allergy tests
• Leukemia or other bone marrow disorders: Bone marrow biopsy, immunophenotyping, chromosome analysis"
"My report mentions a ""left shift."" What does this mean?","A ""left shift"" is a phrase used to note that there are young/immature white blood cells present. Most commonly, this means that there is an infection or inflammation present and the bone marrow is producing more WBCs and releasing them into the blood before they are fully mature. This is a natural immune response to infection and inflammation."
When is the pertussis vaccine given?,"Three different formulations of the pertussis vaccine are available, typically in combination with the tetanus and diphtheria vaccines (DPT). The vaccination is given to infants as a series of shots. Children who have not completed the series of vaccinations are at a higher risk of becoming infected. Even some people who have been vaccinated may still be infected by B. pertussis, but they tend to have a less severe illness.
Pregnant women are advised to be re-vaccinated to prevent transmission of pertussis to their newborns. Grandparents and other caretakers who will be spending time with a newborn are also advised to be re-vaccinated."
Why is my travel history important to my healthcare practitioner?,International travelers should be aware that many resource-limited countries do not have widespread vaccination programs for whooping cough. Infants who have not completed their series of vaccinations and people who have not had a recent booster vaccine may be at an increased risk of contracting whooping cough.
Can a throat swab be used instead of a nasopharyngeal sample from my nose? ,"A throat swab is not acceptable. During a pertussis infection, the bacteria are found in the back of the nose, not in the throat or the front portion of the nose."
Can whooping cough testing be done in my healthcare practitioner's office?,"No. There is no simple, rapid diagnostic test for whooping cough. It requires specialized equipment and is typically performed in clinical laboratories. Not every laboratory performs this testing and samples may need to be sent to a public health laboratory."
Why did my doctor report my child's whooping cough? ,"Healthcare practitioners are required to report whooping cough to state health departments. Outbreaks are tracked and interventions, such as vaccination and appropriate prophylactic antibiotic treatment, may be provided to help limit the outbreak."
My doctor said I have Bordetella parapertussis. Is this the same as whooping cough?,"B. parapertussis are bacteria that can infect humans in the same manner as B. pertussis, but the infection usually causes a milder respiratory illness. Culture methods and PCR tests can detect and distinguish B. parapertussis from B. pertussis, and both are commonly tested for since the signs and symptoms may be similar in people with either infection. Blood tests may not detect antibodies to B. parapertussis and there is no vaccine to prevent B. parapertussis infection."
Can this test be performed in my healthcare practitioner's office?,"The samples may be collected in a healthcare practitioner's office, but more often the test is conducted at a sample drawing (phlebotomy) station. Sample analysis must be done in a laboratory and may need to be sent to a reference laboratory."
Is it really necessary to save all of my urine over 5 hours?,"Yes. In order to accurately interpret absorption and excretion during this time period, you should save all of your urine."
Why is the fasting blood sample collected?,This measurement of xylose in a fasting sample is used as a baseline. It should be negative or very low prior to receiving the xylose dose.
Is there a reason to repeat a xylose test?,"Usually only if the healthcare provider feels that the first set of test results was compromised in some way, such as due to an interfering medication or because the person tested was unable to tolerate and retain the normal xylose dose (nausea and vomiting)."
Why would malabsorption cause vitamin deficiency?,"Malabsorption can cause vitamin deficiency because the vitamins cannot be absorbed normally and because fat-soluble vitamins such as A, E, K, and D can be ""trapped"" in and eliminated with fat in fatty stools."
Can Zika virus be passed from person to person?,"Yes. It can be spread from a pregnant woman to her developing baby. In rare cases, it can be spread from person-to-person through sexual contact. The CDC recommends that until more is known about Zika and pregnancy, pregnant women use condoms with male sexual partners who have lived or traveled to areas with Zika. In rare cases, Zika may be transmitted through blood transfusion or organ donation. Health officials are still investigating reports of Zika transmission via blood transfusion in Brazil."
"If I have had a Zika infection, can I get it again?","If you've been infected with Zika once, it's unlikely that you will be infected again."
"Besides ZPP and lead levels, what other tests might my doctor order to monitor exposure to lead?","If you are in an occupational setting where you are frequently exposed to lead, your healthcare practitioner may order the following tests to evaluate your kidneys and red blood cell production:

BUN
Creatinine
Urinalysis
CBC or hemoglobin and hematocrit
Peripheral blood smear"
"If I have a hobby such as stained glass working but no symptoms, do I need to have a ZPP test done?","Talk to your healthcare provider about this. If the hobby is a frequent activity, then it may be recommended that you have a ZPP test and a lead test to evaluate your lead exposure. You can have an increased ZPP level with few to no symptoms or you may have symptoms that have not yet been linked to lead exposure."
Should everyone have a ZPP test?,"No. This test will only be done for adults with suspected chronic exposure to lead, as a screening test to detect iron deficiency in children, or occasionally to test for a porphyria that affects the skin. "
